- Attackers can abuse this information to gather #Intelligence on a person or group
- Example
\t- Manager visits a coffee shop every morning and posts a picture to social media
\t- Attackers learn manager is not in office
\t- Manager could be targeted at coffee shop or attackers could target someone/something else in the office more easily because the manager is not present

'","b'# Security Policy
This file defines the security policy for NvDialog. As NvDialog does not use any libraries to detect stack overflows and use after frees, patches are
done manually on a regular basis (Usually included as a whole under a single release). For the best results, you are advised to always update to the latest version
and abstract NvDialog to a safer ""shell"" within your project that will do all the checking for you.

## Supported Versions
Only the latest major / minor version of NvDialog is supported when it comes to security releases. Each patch release will focus on fixing 
vulnerabilities of a minor version.

There was an exception for 0.3.0, which received a security update as an attacker could gain access to the application by overflowing a string, causing stack corruption.
However it only received the said update as part of the 0.5.0 upgrade.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you find a vulnerability, make sure to immediately report it to the [Issues](https://github.com/AndroGR/nvdialog/issues) page so it can be fixed as soon as
possible. Vulnerabilities will usually be prioritized unless they are not threatening (eg. an integer overflow that could cause a segmentation fault can be fixed with a cast), and are expected to be
fixed at most in one to two weeks.

NextAuth.js practices responsible disclosure.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We request that you contact us directly to report serious issues that might impact the security of sites using NextAuth.js.

If you contact us regarding a serious issue:

- We will endeavor to get back to you within 72 hours.
- We will aim to publish a fix within 30 days.
- We will disclose the issue (and credit you, with your consent) once a fix to resolve the issue has been released.
- If 90 days has elapsed and we still don't have a fix, we will disclose the issue publicly.

The best way to report an issue is by contacting us via email at hi@thvu.dev, info@balazsorban.com and yo@ndo.dev, or raise a public issue requesting someone get in touch with you via whatever means you prefer for more details. (Please do not disclose sensitive details publicly at this stage.)

> For less serious issues (e.g. RFC compliance for unsupported flows or potential issues that may cause a problem in the future) it is appropriate to submit these publicly as bug reports or feature requests or to raise a question to open a discussion around them.

## Supported Versions

Security updates are only released for the current version.

### Our Obligations
Without limiting any provision of the Aptible Terms of Service, we will implement reasonable and appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful loss, access or disclosure.

### Your Obligations
Our documentation may specify restrictions on how the Services may be configured, or specifications for Aptible Deploy Container Services such as apps. You agree to comply with any such restrictions or specifications.

You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Services and taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection and backup of Your Content, which may include the use of encryption technology to protect Your Content from unauthorized access and routinely archiving Your Content. Aptible provides many built-in controls for you, as discussed herein. Where configurable or optional security controls (such as encryption) are offered as part of the Services, you are responsible for configuring or enabling those controls. You are ultimately responsible for determining whether the security controls applied to your Applications and data are sufficient for your requirements.

Aptible access credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use only. You may not sell, transfer or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your behalf.

Pursuant to Section 2 of the Aptible Terms of Service, you will not use the Services to create, receive, maintain, or transmit electronic HIPAA PHI or GDPR Personal Data without the corresponding agreement legal agreement (HIPAA Business Associate Agreement or GDPR Data Processing Addendum) in place between you and Aptible.

### Penetration Testing Authorization
You may conduct penetration tests of your dedicated Deploy Stacks. Aptible Deploy\'s underlying infrastructure is covered by the ""Permitted Services"" listed in [AWS\'s Penetration Testing Policy](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/), and you are responsible for adhering to their policy.

If your testing falls under AWS\'s definition of [Other Simulated Events](https://aws.amazon.com/security/penetration-testing/#Other_Simulated_Events_), you must have this activity pre-approved by Aptible, who will submit a request for authorization with AWS.

### Reporting Security Vulnerabilities
If you discover a potential security vulnerability, please see our policy on [Responsible Disclosure](/legal/responsible-disclosure). We strongly prefer that you notify us in private. Publicly disclosing a security vulnerability without informing us first puts the community at risk. When you notify us of a potential problem, we will work with you to make sure we understand the scope and cause of the issue. Thank you!

#### **1. Data Center Security**
Aptible runs on the Amazon Web Services global infrastructure platform.

AWS publishes an [""Overview of Security Processes"" whitepaper](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf) that serves as the reference material for this section. SOC 2 reports are available directly from AWS upon request.

##### **1.A - Compliance**
> AWS computing environments are continuously audited, with certifications from accreditation bodies across geographies and verticals, including ISO 27001, FedRAMP, DoD CSM, and PCI DSS. Additionally AWS also has assurance programs that provide templates and control mappings to help customers establish the compliance of their environments running on AWS against 20+ standards, including the HIPAA, CESG (UK), and Singapore Multi-tier Cloud Security (MTCS) standards.

p. 6 - [""Introduction to AWS Security - July 2015""](https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/Intro_to_AWS_Security.pdf)

##### **1.B - Physical Security**
> AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.

p. 5 - [""Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes - May 2017""]

##### **1.C - Environmental Security**
AWS data center environmental controls include:

- Fire detection and suppression systems
- Redundant power systems, backed by Uninterruptible Power Supply units and generators
- Climate and temperature controls
- Active system monitoring

pp. 5-8 - [""Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes - May 2017""]

#### **2. Aptible Deploy Network Security**
Please see our [Reference Architecture Diagram](/assets/deploy-reference-architecture.pdf) for an explanation of the terms in this section.

##### **2.A - Secure Architecture**
Aptible Aptible Deploy stacks run in separate AWS Virtual Private Clouds. Each stack is an isolated network. Most services run in a private subnet. Only SSL/TLS endpoints and a bastion host are exposed to the Internet. Backend users connect to the stack through the bastion host, which restricts access to stack components and logs activity for review.

##### **2.B - Firewalls**
All public-facing EC2 instances use inbound Security Group rules configured in deny-all mode. Ports are opened as necessary for: administrative SSH access, Aptible Deploy SSH Portal Access, and Redis. Public-facing Aptible Deploy Endpoints (which consist in part of an AWS load balancer) are configured to allow traffic on all ports, but only listen on the specific ports required for functionality (e.g., 80 and 443 for an HTTPS Endpoint).

##### **2.C - DDoS Protection and Mitigation**
Aptible Deploy\'s VPC-based approach means that most stack components are not accessible from the Internet, and cannot be targeted directly by a DDoS attack.

Aptible Deploy SSL/TLS endpoints include an AWS Elastic Load Balancer, which only supports valid TCP requests, meaning DDoS attacks such as UDP and SYN floods will not reach your app layer.

Should you need to add capacity to deal with a potential attack, you can instantly scale your stack using the Aptible dashboard or command line tool.

##### **2.D - Port Scanning**
AWS monitors and stops unauthorized port scanning. Because most of an Aptible Deploy stack is private, and all hosts run strict firewalls, port scanning is generally ineffective.

##### **2.E - Spoofing & Sniffing**
The AWS network prohibits a host from sending traffic with a source IP or MAC address other than its own. The AWS hypervisor will also not deliver any traffic to a host the traffic is not addressed to, meaning even an instance running in promiscuous mode will not receive or be able to ""sniff"" traffic intended for other hosts.

p. 13 - [""Amazon Web Services: Overview of Security Processes - May 2017""]

##### **2.F - Network and Host Vulnerability Scanning**
Aptible scans both the Internet-facing network and private network of a master reference stack each month. Aptible is responsible for network and host security, and remediates adverse findings without customer intervention, however you may request a scan of your dedicated VPC and its hosts as needed for your own security assessments and audits.  The scope of this scan is limited to the underlying Deploy architecture, and does not include your apps, databases, or endpoints.

#### **3. Aptible Deploy Platform Security**

##### **3.A - Configuration and Change Management**
For app services that have an SSL/TLS endpoint attached, Aptible Deploy performs a health check on the container set before promoting it to the current release. If the health check fails, the container set is not promoted. Either way, the deploy is zero-downtime.

For any deploy, you can roll back to a previous codebase by pushing a different ref to your app\'s Git endpoint.

##### **3.B - Isolation**
Dedicated Aptible Deploy environments are deployed on AWS VPC-based dedicated stacks, isolated at the customer level. The VPC, network, underlying instances, and AWS virtual infrastructure for your dedicated stack are not shared with any other tenant.

##### **3.C - Logging and Monitoring**
Aptible logs AWS and Aptible API activity, and host activity within your stack. Aptible Deploy monitors performance indicators such as disk, memory, compute, and logging issues, and automatically resolves them on your behalf.

##### **3.D - Intrusion Detection & Prevention**
Aptible Deploy [Managed Host-based Intrusion Detection (HIDS)] is installed on each host that runs your containers by default and will detect potential intrusions and other anomalous activities.

The Aptible Security Team monitors and investigates each event to determine the legitimacy of all activity. Crucially, the Aptible Security Team immediately responds to and resolves any issues that are discovered through investigation of anomalous activity and will notify you of any remediation steps taken.

You can optionally subscribe to the Aptible Deploy HIDS Compliance Report to provide your customers and auditors evidence that you are using HIDS to monitor, analyze, and remediate security events.

##### **3.E - Host Hardening**
Aptible Deploy host operating systems are hardened based on the Center for Internet Security\'s Security Configuration Benchmark for the OS and version in use. For all operating systems:

- Operating systems are installed on hosts only from bare images, and only via automated configuration management. Services installed can be enumerated upon request.
- Host password logins are disabled. SSH root keys are not permitted.
- No user SSH keys are permitted on hosts by default. Aptible internal workforce user access is configured only on a per-user basis, and only when necessary to provide customer support.
- Swap is disabled to avoid writing in-memory secrets to unencrypted volumes.
- Command history for shell sessions is disabled.
- Non-default SSH ports are used.
- No password-based services are installed automatically. Password-based services (such as PostgreSQL) are provisioned only with unique, per-resource, Aptible-generated passphrases. No default passwords are permitted.
- Host security updates are automated.
- All host ports are opened only via whitelist.

##### **3.F - Your Code**
SSH public key authentication is used to limit access to your authorized backend users during git-based deploys. Following a successful push to an Aptible git endpoint, code is copied down to your stack\'s build layer. The resulting images are pushed to a private stack registry, backed by AWS S3, which provides redundant, access-controlled storage.

##### **3.G - Databases**
Databases run in the database layer of your stack, on a private subnet accessible only from app or bastion layer. SSL/TLS is required if the database protocol supports it. Disk volumes backing databases are encrypted at the filesystem level using Aptible-managed AES encryption. Aptible manages the creation, access security, and destruction of encryption keys. You can check whether your database uses AES-192 or AES-256 in the Aptible Deploy dashboard. You can rekey the database by dumping/restoring it at any time. You may implement additional controls, such as database security policies or row-/column-level encryption with keys you manage.

##### **3.H - Aptible Deploy Penetration Testing**
Aptible conducts penetration testing of the Aptible Deploy infrastructure at least annually. These tests consist of open-ended, best-effort security assessments performed by qualified third-party testing firms that specialize in cloud and containerized infrastructures. The testers review the Aptible Deploy architecture, are given full read access to Aptible Deploy source code (and access to the Aptible Deploy engineering team to answer questions throughout the test), and are given privileged internal (i.e., backdoor) access to a sandbox Aptible Deploy environment. From this context, the testers attempt to identify vulnerabilities in Aptible Deploy\xe2\x80\x99s control plane, core API, authentication API, and related Aptible Deploy services. 

You may conduct testing of your dedicated Aptible Deploy Stacks and containerized applications as described above (\xe2\x80\x9cPenetration Testing Authorization\xe2\x80\x9d).

##### **3.I - Aptible Deploy Vulnerability Remediation**
All vulnerabilities are classified by severity according to the level of risk they present to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of Aptible services and customer data.  Vulnerabilities are remediated on a timeline commensurate with the severity:

 - Critical - within 24 hours
 - High - within 7 days
 - Medium - within 30 days
 - Low - within 90 days

#### **4. Aptible Deploy Business Continuity**
##### **4.A - Backups**
Aptible automatically backs up several different types of data:

- Customer Aptible Deploy app code and the container images built from that code are stored in private, redundant, access-controlled registries. Aptible recommends that you maintain the canonical version of your codebase in a distributed version control system, such as GitHub. In the event of an app-level outage, Aptible Deploy automatically restores services from registry backups.

- Customer metadata is stored in the Aptible APIs, backed by the Amazon Relational Database Service. This metadata includes customer account data (passwords, permissions, SSH keys), and Aptible Deploy configuration data, such as environmental variables. Backups are taken nightly and retained for one week.

- Aptible Deploy customer database disks are automatically backed up every 24 hours and retained as per the policy defined by each customer. No customer action is required for the automated backups to be generated. In addition to defining the retention period, customers can also specify that we should make two copies of each backup: One in the region where the database runs, to facilitate fast disaster recovery; the other in a separate geographic region to protect against loss of the original region. Customers may also take on-demand backups. Please see the [Aptible Deploy database backup](https://deploy-docs.aptible.com/docs/database-backups) documentation for more information.

##### **4.B - Fault Tolerance**
AWS data centers are clustered into regions, and sub-clustered into availability zones, each of which is designed as an independent failure zone, meaning they are:

- Physically separated
- Located in lower-risk flood plains
- Equipped with independent uninterruptable power supplies and onsite backup generators
- Fed via different grids from independent utilities, and
- Redundantly connected to multiple tier-1 transit providers

For dedicated environments, Aptible Deploy automatically distributes app containers across availability zones when a service is scaled to more than one container.

##### **4.C - High Availability**
Aptible Deploy allows you to set up high-availability clustering for databases that support it.

App services on v2 stacks are automatically distributed across AWS availability zones as soon as they are scaled to more than one container.

##### **4.D - Disaster Prevention and Recovery**
Aptible monitors the stability and availability of customer infrastructure and automatically recovers from disruptions, including app and database failures. In the event of a disaster, Aptible restores apps from the last healthy build image and restores data from the last backup. In the event of a database outage, Aptible Deploy will automatically recover the underlying database instance and disk. If the disk is unavailable, Aptible Deploy will restore from a backup. Raw database snapshots and restored database clones are available upon request for testing and recovery.

##### **5 - Aptible Internal Security**

##### **5.A - Aptible Access**
We do not access or use Your Content for any purpose other than for developing and operating the Services and as required by law. As a routine matter, Aptible workforce members do not require access to data processed by your Aptible Deploy Containerized Services, such as data stored in your databases. Aptible workforce members are granted least-privilege access to customer environments only when a specific business need arises. Workforce members undergo criminal background screening before hire. In some cases, such as Aptible Deploy databases, you may encrypt Your Content using keys you manage.

##### **5.B - Security Management**
Aptible manages information security consistent with SOC 2, HITRUST, and applicable legal and regulatory requirements such as HIPAA and GDPR. 

- You can view Aptible\'s [HITRUST CSF standalone certification letter here](/compliance/hitrust-csf-certification/). 
- Aptible\'s current SOC 2 Type 2 report and HITRUST CSF Validated Assessment Report are available under NDA, please [contact us].

We also run a [responsible disclosure program](/legal/responsible-disclosure) for security vulnerabilities, with cash bounties.

This policy is adapted from the policies of the following CNCF projects:

* [Rook](https://github.com/rook/rook)
* [Containerd](https://github.com/containerd/project)

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, either:

1. Report it on Github directly you can follow the procedure described
   [here](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
   and:

    - Navigate to the [security tab](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/security) on the repository
    - Click on 'Advisories'
    - Click on 'Report a vulnerability'
    - Detail the issue, see below for some expamples of info that might be
      useful including.

2. Send an email to `crossplane-security@lists.cncf.io` detailing the issue,
   see below for some examples of info that might be useful including.

The reporter(s) can typically expect a response within 24 hours acknowledging
the issue was received. If a response is not received within 24 hours, please
reach out to any
[maintainer](https://github.com/crossplane/crossplane/blob/master/OWNERS.md#maintainers)
directly to confirm receipt of the issue.

### Report Content

Make sure to include all the details that might help maintainers better
understand and prioritize it, for example here is a list of details that might be
worth adding:

- Versions of Crossplane used and more broadly of any other software involved,
  e.g. Kubernetes, providers, ...
- Detailed list of steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
- Consequences of the vulnerability.
- Severity you feel should be attributed to the vulnerabilities.
- Screenshots, logs or Kubernetes Events

Feel free to extend the list above with everything else you think would be
useful.

## Review Process

Once a maintainer has confirmed the relevance of the report, a draft security
advisory will be created on Github. The draft advisory will be used to discuss
the issue with maintainers, the reporter(s), and Crossplane's security advisors.
If the reporter(s) wishes to participate in this discussion, then provide
reporter Github username(s) to be invited to the discussion. If the reporter(s)
does not wish to participate directly in the discussion, then the reporter(s)
can request to be updated regularly via email.

If the vulnerability is accepted, a timeline for developing a patch, public
disclosure, and patch release will be determined. If there is an embargo period
on public disclosure before the patch release, an announcement will be sent to
the security announce mailing list (`crossplane-security-announce@lists.cncf.io`)
announcing the scope of the vulnerability, the date of availability of the
patch release, and the date of public disclosure. The reporter(s) are expected
to participate in the discussion of the timeline and abide by agreed upon dates
for public disclosure.

## Public Disclosure Process

Vulnerabilities once fixed, will be disclosed via email to
`crossplane-security-announce@lists.cncf.io`, shared publicly as a Github [security
advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories)
and mentioned in the fixed versions' release notes.

## Supported Versions

See [Crossplane's documentation](https://docs.crossplane.io/master/reference/release-cycle/)
for information on supported versions of crossplane. Any supported
release branch may receive security updates. For any security issues discovered
on older versions, non-core packages, or dependencies, please inform maintainers
using the same security mailing list as for reporting vulnerabilities.

## Joining the security announce mailing list

The security announcement mailing list
`crossplane-security-announce@lists.cncf.io`, will be used to announce
vulnerabilities, often ahead of when a fix is made available, to a restricted
set of Crossplane adopters and vendors.

Any organization or individual who directly uses crossplane and non-core
packages in production or in a security critical application is eligible to
join the security announce mailing list. Indirect users who use crossplane
through a vendor are not expected to join, but should request their vendor
join. To join the mailing list, the individual or organization must be
sponsored by either a crossplane maintainer or security advisor as well as have
a record of properly handling non-public security information. If a sponsor
cannot be found, sponsorship may be requested at
`crossplane-security-announce@lists.cncf.io`. Sponsorship should not be
requested via public channels since membership of the security announce list is
not public.

## Supported Versions

| Version | Supported |
|-------  | --------- |
| Latest stable  | Yes       |
| Latest nightly  | Yes       |

Important security fixes always result in a patch release to the latest stable.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We\'re extremely grateful for security researchers and users that report vulnerabilities to Netdata Open Source Community. All reports are thoroughly investigated by a set of community volunteers.

To make a report, please send an email to **security@netdata.cloud** with
the vulnerability details and the details expected for [all Netdata bug
reports](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/BUG_REPORT.yml).

### Awards

We reward newly reported vulnerabilities with Netdata swag. We do not offer monetary awards for vulnerability reports.

### When Should I Report a Vulnerability?

-   You think you discovered a potential security vulnerability in Netdata
-   You are unsure how a vulnerability affects Netdata
-   You think you discovered a vulnerability in another project that Netdata depends on (e.g. python, node, etc)

### When Should I NOT Report a Vulnerability?

-   You need help tuning Netdata for security
-   You need help applying security related updates
-   Your issue is not security related

### Security Vulnerability Response

Each report is acknowledged and analyzed by Netdata Team members within 3 working days. This will set off a Security Release Process.

Any vulnerability information shared with the Netdata Team stays within the Netdata project and will not be disseminated to other projects unless it is necessary to get the issue fixed.

As the security issue moves from triage, to identified fix, to release planning we will keep the reporter updated.

### Public Disclosure Timing

A public disclosure date is negotiated by the Netdata team and the bug submitter. We prefer to fully disclose the bug as soon as possible once a user mitigation is available. It is reasonable to delay disclosure when the bug or the fix is not yet fully understood, the solution is not well-tested, or for vendor coordination. The timeframe for disclosure is from immediate (especially if it\'s already publicly known) to a few weeks. As a basic default, we expect report date to disclosure date to be on the order of 7 days. The Netdata team holds the final say when setting a disclosure date.

### Security Announcements

Every time a security issue is fixed in Netdata, we immediately release a new version of it. So, to get notified of all security incidents, please subscribe to our releases on github.

title: Pod Security Policy
content_type: concept

<!-- overview -->

{{< feature-state state=""beta"" >}}

Pod Security Policies (kebijakan keamanan Pod) memungkinkan otorisasi secara detil dari pembuatan dan pembaruan Pod.



<!-- body -->

## Apa itu Pod Security Policy?

_Pod Security Policy_ adalah sebuah sumber daya pada tingkat klaster yang mengatur aspek-aspek spesifikasi Pod yang sensitif terhadap keamanan. Objek-objek `PodSecurityPolicy` mendefinisikan sebuah kumpulan kondisi yang harus dijalankan oleh Pod untuk dapat diterima oleh sistem, dan juga sebagai nilai-nilai bawaan untuk kolom-kolom yang bersangkutan. Mereka memungkinkan administrator untuk mengatur hal-hal berikut:

| Aspek yang diatur                                      | Nama Kolom                                 |

| Penggunaan jaringan dan _port_ milik _host_         | [`hostNetwork`, `hostPorts`](#host-namespaces) |
| Penggunaan jenis-jenis Volume                       | [`volumes`](#volumes-and-file-systems)      |
| Penggunaan _filesystem_ milik _host_                | [`allowedHostPaths`](#volumes-and-file-systems) |

| Membatasi eskalasi ke kemampuan _root_              | [`allowPrivilegeEscalation`, `defaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation`](#privilege-escalation) |

| Profil sysctl yang digunakan oleh Container         | [`forbiddenSysctls`,`allowedUnsafeSysctls`](#sysctl)                      |

## Mengaktifkan Pod Security Policy

Pengaturan Pod Security Policy diimplementasi sebagai sebuah opsi (tapi direkomendasikan untuk digunakan) dari [_admission controller_](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podsecuritypolicy). PodSecurityPolicy dilaksanakan dengan [mengaktifkan _admission controller_-nya](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#how-do-i-turn-on-an-admission-control-plug-in), tetapi melakukan hal ini tanpa mengizinkan kebijakan apapun **akan menghalangi Pod apapun untuk dibuat** di dalam klaster.

Sejak API dari Pod Security Policy (`policy/v1beta1/podsecuritypolicy`) diaktifkan secara independen dari _admission controller_, untuk klaster-klaster yang sudah ada direkomendasikan untuk menambahkan dan mengizinkan kebijakan yang bersangkutan sebelum mengaktifkan _admission controller_ tersebut.

## Mengizinkan Kebijakan

Saat sebuah sumber daya PodSecurityPolicy dibuat, ia tidak melakukan apa-apa. Untuk menggunakannya, [Service Account](/id/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/) dari pengguna yang memintanya atau target Pod-nya harus diizinkan terlebih dahulu untuk menggunakan kebijakan tersebut, dengan membolehkan kata kerja `use` terhadap kebijakan tersebut.

Kebanyakan Pod Kubernetes tidak dibuat secara langsung oleh pengguna. Sebagai gantinya, mereka biasanya dibuat secara tidak langsung sebagai bagian dari sebuah [Deployment](/id/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/), [ReplicaSet](/id/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/), atau pengontrol yang sudah ditemplat lainnya melalui Controller Manager. Memberikan akses untuk pengontrol terhadap kebijakan tersebut akan mengizinkan akses untuk *semua* Pod yang dibuat oleh pengontrol tersebut, sehingga metode yang lebih baik untuk mengizinkan kebijakan adalah dengan memberikan akses pada Service Account milik Pod (lihat [contohnya](#run-another-pod)).

### Melalui RBAC

[RBAC](/id/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/) adalah mode otorisasi standar Kubernetes, dan dapat digunakan dengan mudah untuk mengotorisasi penggunaan kebijakan-kebijakan.

Pertama-tama, sebuah `Role` atau `ClusterRole` perlu memberikan akses pada kata kerja `use` terhadap kebijakan-kebijakan yang diinginkan. `rules` yang digunakan untuk memberikan akses tersebut terlihat seperti berikut:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: <role name>
rules:
- apiGroups: [\'policy\']
  resources: [\'podsecuritypolicies\']
  verbs:     [\'use\']
  resourceNames:
  - <list of policies to authorize>
```

Kemudian, `Role` atau `ClusterRole` tersebut diikat ke pengguna-pengguna yang diberikan otoritas.

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: <binding name>
roleRef:
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: <role name>
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
subjects:
# Mengotorisasi ServiceAccount spesifik
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <authorized service account name>
  namespace: <authorized pod namespace>
# Mengotorisasi User spesifik (tidak direkomendasikan)
- kind: User
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  name: <authorized user name>
```

Jika sebuah `RoleBinding` (bukan `ClusterRoleBinding`) digunakan, maka ia hanya akan memberi akses penggunaan untuk Pod-Pod yang dijalankan pada Namespace yang sama dengan `RoleBinding` tersebut. Hal ini dapat dipasangkan dengan grup sistem untuk memberi akses pada semua Pod yang berjalan di Namespace tersebut:

```yaml
# Mengotorisasi semua ServiceAccount di dalam sebuah Namespace
- kind: Group
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  name: system:serviceaccounts
# Atau secara ekuivalen, semua pengguna yang telah terotentikasi pada sebuah Namespace
- kind: Group
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  name: system:authenticated
```

Untuk lebih banyak contoh pengikatan RBAC, lihat [Contoh Role Binding](/id/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac#role-binding-examples).
Untuk contoh lengkap untuk mengotorisasi sebuah PodSecurityPolicy, lihat [di bawah](#contoh).

### Mengatasi Masalah

- [Controller Manager](/docs/admin/kube-controller-manager/) harus dijalankan terhadap [port API yang telah diamankan](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/controlling-access/), dan tidak boleh memiliki izin _superuser_, atau semua permintaan akan melewati modul-modul otentikasi dan otorisasi, semua objek PodSecurityPolicy tidak akan diizinkan, dan semua pengguna dapat membuat Container-container yang _privileged_. Untuk lebih detil tentang mengkonfigurasi otorisasi Controller Manager, lihat [Controller Roles](/id/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/#controller-roles).

## Urutan Kebijakan

Sebagai tambahan terhadap membatasi pembuatan dan pembaruan Pod, Pod Security Policy dapat digunakan juga untuk menyediakan nilai-nilai bawaan untuk banyak kolom yang dikontrol olehnya. Saat banyak kebijakan tersedia, pengatur Pod Security Policy memilih kebijakan-kebijakan berdasarkan kriteria berikut:

1. PodSecurityPolicy yang mengizinkan Pod apa adanya, tanpa mengganti nilai-nilai bawaan atau memutasi Pod tersebut, akan lebih dipilih. Urutan PodSecurityPolicy yang tidak mengubah Pod ini tidak dipermasalahkan.
2. Jika Pod-nya harus diberi nilai bawaan atau dimutasi, maka PodSecurityPolicy pertama (diurutkan berdasarkan namanya) untuk mengizinkan Pod tersebut akan dipilih.

{{< note >}}
Saat operasi pembaruan (saat ini mutasi terhadap spesifikasi Pod tidak diizinkan) hanya PodSecurityPolicy yang tidak mengubah Pod yang akan digunakan untuk melakukan validasi terhadap Pod tersebut.
{{< /note >}}

## Contoh

_Contoh ini mengasumsikan kamu telah memiliki klaster yang berjalan dengan _admission controller_ PodSecurityPolicy diaktifkan, dan kamu mempunyai akses admin._

### Persiapan

Mempersiapkan sebuah Namespace dan ServiceAccount untuk digunakan pada contoh ini. Kita akan menggunakan ServiceAccount ini untuk meniru sebuah pengguna bukan admin.

```shell
kubectl create namespace psp-example
kubectl create serviceaccount -n psp-example fake-user
kubectl create rolebinding -n psp-example fake-editor --clusterrole=edit --serviceaccount=psp-example:fake-user
```

Untuk memperjelas kita bertindak sebagai pengguna yang mana dan mempersingkat ketikan, kita akan membuat 2 alias:

```shell
alias kubectl-admin=\'kubectl -n psp-example\'
alias kubectl-user=\'kubectl --as=system:serviceaccount:psp-example:fake-user -n psp-example\'
```

### Membuat sebuah kebijakan dan sebuah Pod

Beri definisi objek contoh PodSecurityPolicy dalam sebuah berkas. Ini adalah kebijakan yang mencegah pembuatan Pod-Pod yang _privileged_.

{{< codenew file=""policy/example-psp.yaml"" >}}

Dan buatlah PodSecurityPolicy tersebut dengan `kubectl`:

```shell
kubectl-admin create -f example-psp.yaml
```

Sekarang, sebagai pengguna bukan admin, cobalah membuat Pod sederhana:

```shell
kubectl-user create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:      pause
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause
EOF
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating ""STDIN"": pods ""pause"" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: []
```

**Apa yang terjadi?** Walaupun PodSecurityPolicy tersebut telah dibuat, ServiceAccount dari Pod tersebut maupun `fake-user` tidak memikiki izin untuk menggunakan kebijakan tersebut:

```shell
kubectl-user auth can-i use podsecuritypolicy/example
no
```

Membuat RoleBinding untuk memberikan `fake-user` akses terhadap kata kerja `use` pada kebijakan contoh kita:

{{< note >}}
Ini bukan cara yang direkomendasikan! Lihat [bagian selanjutnya](#menjalankan-pod-lainnya) untuk cara yang lebih baik.
{{< /note >}}

```shell
kubectl-admin create role psp:unprivileged \\
    --verb=use \\
    --resource=podsecuritypolicy \\
    --resource-name=example
role ""psp:unprivileged"" created

kubectl-admin create rolebinding fake-user:psp:unprivileged \\
    --role=psp:unprivileged \\
    --serviceaccount=psp-example:fake-user
rolebinding ""fake-user:psp:unprivileged"" created

kubectl-user auth can-i use podsecuritypolicy/example
yes
```

Sekarang, ulangi membuat Pod tersebut

```shell
kubectl-user create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:      pause
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause
EOF
pod ""pause"" created
```

Bekerja seperti yang diharapkan! Tapi percobaan apapun untuk membuat Pod yang _privileged_ seharusnya masih ditolak:

```shell
kubectl-user create -f- <<EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name:      privileged
spec:
  containers:
    - name:  pause
      image: registry.k8s.io/pause
      securityContext:
        privileged: true
EOF
Error from server (Forbidden): error when creating ""STDIN"": pods ""privileged"" is forbidden: unable to validate against any pod security policy: [spec.containers[0].securityContext.privileged: Invalid value: true: Privileged containers are not allowed]
```

Hapus Pod tersebut sebelum melanjutkan:

```shell
kubectl-user delete pod pause
```

### Menjalankan Pod lainnya

Mari coba lagi, dengan cara yang sedikit berbeda:

```shell
kubectl-user run pause --image=registry.k8s.io/pause
deployment ""pause"" created

kubectl-user get pods
No resources found.

kubectl-user get events | head -n 2
LASTSEEN   FIRSTSEEN   COUNT     NAME              KIND         SUBOBJECT                TYPE      REASON                  SOURCE                                  MESSAGE
1m         2m          15        pause-7774d79b5   ReplicaSet                            Warning   FailedCreate            replicaset-controller                   Error creating: pods ""pause-7774d79b5-"" is forbidden: no providers available to validate pod request
```

**Apa yang terjadi?** Kita telah mengikat Role `psp:unprivileged` untuk `fake-user` kita, kenapa kita mendapatkan kesalahan `Error creating:  pods ""pause-7774d79b5-"" is forbidden: no providers available to validate pod request`? Jawabannya berada pada sumbernya - `replicaset-controller`. Fake-user berhasil membuat Deployment tersebut (yang berhasil membuat sebuah ReplicaSet), tetapi saat ReplicaSet tersebut akan membuat Pod, ia tidak terotorisasi untuk menggunakan PodSecurityPolicy contoh tersebut.

Untuk memperbaikinya, ikatlah Role `psp:unprivileged` pada ServiceAccount Pod tersebut. Pada kasus ini (karena kita tidak menspesifikasikannya) ServiceAccount-nya adalah `default`:

```shell
kubectl-admin create rolebinding default:psp:unprivileged \\
    --role=psp:unprivileged \\
    --serviceaccount=psp-example:default
rolebinding ""default:psp:unprivileged"" created
```

Sekarang, jika kamu memberi waktu ReplicaSet-nya untuk mencoba kembali, pengatur ReplicaSet tersebut seharusnya akan berhasil membuat Pod tersebut.

```shell
kubectl-user get pods --watch
NAME                    READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
pause-7774d79b5-qrgcb   0/1       Pending   0         1s
pause-7774d79b5-qrgcb   0/1       Pending   0         1s
pause-7774d79b5-qrgcb   0/1       ContainerCreating   0         1s
pause-7774d79b5-qrgcb   1/1       Running   0         2s
```

### Membersihkan

Hapus Namespace tersebut untuk membersihkan sebagian besar sumber daya yang digunakan dalam contoh ini:

```shell
kubectl-admin delete ns psp-example
namespace ""psp-example"" deleted
```

Perlu diperhatikan bahwa sumber daya `PodSecurityPolicy` tidak diberi Namespace, dan harus dibersihkan secara terpisah:

```shell
kubectl-admin delete psp example
podsecuritypolicy ""example"" deleted
```

### Contoh-contoh Kebijakan

Berikut adalah kebijakan dengan batasan paling sedikit yang dapat kamu buat, ekuivalen dengan tidak menggunakan _admission controller_ Pod Security Policy:

{{< codenew file=""policy/privileged-psp.yaml"" >}}

Berikut adalah sebuah contoh kebijakan yang restriktif yang mengharuskan pengguna-pengguna untuk berjalan sebagai pengguna yang _unprivileged_, memblokir kemungkinan eskalasi menjadi _root_, dan mengharuskan penggunaan beberapa mekanisme keamanan.

{{< codenew file=""policy/restricted-psp.yaml"" >}}

## Referensi Kebijakan

### Privileged

**Privileged** - menentukan bila Container manapun di dalam sebuah Pod dapat mengaktifkan mode _privileged_. Secara bawaan, sebuah Container tidak diizinkan untuk mengakses perangkat apapun pada _host_-nya, tapi sebuah Container yang ""_privileged_"" akan diberikan akses untuk semua perangkat pada _host_-nya. Hal ini mengizinkan hampir semua akses yang sama dengan proses yang berjalan pada _host_ kepada Container tersebut. Hal ini berfungsi untuk Container-container yang ingin menggunakan kemampuan Linux seperti memanipulasi _network stack_ atau mengakses perangkat-perangkat.
determines if any container in a pod can enable privileged mode.

### Namespace Host

**HostPID** - Mengatur jika Container-container pada Pod dapat berbagi _namespace process ID_ pada _host_. Catatlah bahwa saat dipasangkan dengan ptrace, hal ini dapat digunakan untuk eskalasi _privilege_ di luar kontainer (ptrace secara bawaan tidak diizinkan).

**HostIPC** - Mengatur jika container-container pada Pod dapat berbagi _namespace IPC_ pada _host_.

**HostNetwork** - Mengatur jika Pod dapat menggunakan _namespace_ jaringan pada _host_. Melakukan hal ini akan memberikan Pod akses pada perangkat _loopback_, _service_ yang sedang _listening_ pada _localhost_, dan dapat digunakan untuk mengintai aktivitas jaringan pada Pod-Pod lain pada Node yang sama.

**HostPorts** - Memberikan daftar putih dari berbagai _port_ yang diizinkan pada _namespace_ jaringan pada _host_. Hal ini didefinisikan sebagai sebuah daftar `HostPortRange`, dengan `min`(inklusif) dan `max`(inklusif). Nilai bawaannya adalah tidak ada _host port_ yang diizinkan.

**AllowedHostPaths** - Lihat [Volume dan _file systems_](#volumes-dan-file-systems).

### Volume dan _file system_

**Volume** - Menyediakan sebuah daftar putih dari tipe-tipe Volume yang diizinkan. Nilai-nilai yang diizinkan sesuai dengan sumber Volume yang didefinisikan saat membuat sebuah Volume. Untuk daftar lengkap tipe-tipe Volume, lihat [tipe-tipe Volume](/id/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#tipe-tipe-volume). Sebagai tambahan, `*` dapat digunakan untuk mengizinkan semua tipe Volume.

**Kumpulan Volume-volume minimal yang direkomendasikan** untuk PodSecurityPolicy baru adalah sebagai berikut:

- configMap
- downwardAPI
- emptyDir
- persistentVolumeClaim
- secret
- projected

{{< warning >}}
PodSecurityPolicy tidak membatasi tipe-tipe objek `PersistentVolume` yang dapat direferensikan oleh `PersistentVolumeClaim`. Hanya pengguna-pengguna yang dipercaya yang boleh diberikan izin untuk membuat objek-objek `PersistentVolume`.
{{< /warning >}}

**FSGroup** - Mengatur grup tambahan yang dipasang ke beberapa volume.

- _MustRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Menggunakan semua nilai minimum dari `range` yang pertama sebagai nilai bawaannya. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range`.
- _MayRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Mengizinkan `FSGroups` dibiarkan kosong tanpa memberikan nilai bawaan. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range` jika nilai `FSGroups` disetel.
- _RunAsAny_ - Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang diberikan. Mengizinkan ID `fsGroup` apapun untuk digunakan.

**AllowedHostPaths** - Memperinci sebuah daftar putih dari _host path_ yang diizinkan untuk digunakan oleh volume-volume `hostPath`. Sebuah daftar kosong berarti tidak ada pembatasan pada _host path_ yang digunakan. Hal ini didefinisikan sebagai sebuah daftar objek-objek dengan sebuah kolom `pathPrefix`, yang mengizinkan volume-volume `hostPath` untuk menambatkan sebuah _path_ yang dimulai dengan sebuah prefiks yang diizinkan, dan sebuah kolom `readOnly` yang menunjukkan bahwa ia harus ditambatkan sebagai _read-only_.
Misalnya:

```yaml
allowedHostPaths:
  # Hal ini mengizinkan ""/foo"", ""/foo/"", ""/foo/bar"" dll., tetapi
  # melarang ""/fool"", ""/etc/foo"" dll.
  # ""/foo/../"" tidak sah.
  - pathPrefix: ""/foo""
    readOnly: true # Izinkan hanya tambatan _read-only_
```

{{< warning >}} Ada banyak cara bagi sebuah Container dengan akses yang tidak dibatasi terhadap _host filesystem_-nya untuk dapat melakukan eskalasi _privilege_, termasuk membaca data dari Container-container lain, dan menyalahgunakan kredensial dari _service-service_ sistem, misalnya Kubelet.

Direktori volume `hostPath` yang dapat ditulis mengizinkan container-container untuk menulis ke _filesystem_ melalui cara-cara yang membiarkan mereka melintasi _host filesystem_ di luar `pathPrefix` yang bersangkutan.
`readOnly: true`, tersedia pada Kubernetes 1.11 ke atas, harus digunakan pada **semua** `allowedHostPaths` untuk secara efektif membatasi akses terhadap `pathPrefix` yang diperinci.
{{< /warning >}}

**ReadOnlyRootFilesystem** - Mengharuskan container-container berjalan dengan sebuah _root filesystem_ yang bersifat _read-only_ (yaitu, tanpa lapisan yang dapat ditulis)

### _Driver-driver_ Flexvolume

Hal ini memperinci sebuah daftar putih dari _driver-driver_ Flexvolume yang diizinkan untuk digunakan oleh Flexvolume. Sebuah daftar kosong atau `nil` berarti tidak ada batasan terhadap _driver-driver_ tersebut.
Pastikan kolom [`volumes`](#volume-dan-file-system) berisi tipe volumenya; Jika tidak, tidak ada _driver_ Flexvolume yang diizinkan.

Misalnya:

```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-flex-volumes
spec:
  # ... kolom kolom lainnya
  volumes:
    - flexVolume
  allowedFlexVolumes:
    - driver: example/lvm
    - driver: example/cifs
```

### Pengguna dan Grup

**RunAsUser** - Mengatur ID pengguna mana yang digunakan untuk menjalankan container-container.

- _MustRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Menggunakan semua nilai minimum dari `range` yang pertama sebagai nilai bawaannya. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range`.
- _MustRunAsNonRoot_ - Mengharuskan Pod diajukan dengan nilai `runAsUser` yang bukan nol, atau memiliki petunjuk `USER` didefinisikan (dengan UID numerik) di dalam _image_. Pod-Pod yang belum memperinci `runAsNonRoot` atau `runAsUser` akan dimutasikan untuk menyetel `runAsNonRoot=true` sehingga membutuhkan petunjuk `USER` dengan nilai numerik bukan nol di dalam Container. Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang diberikan. Menyetel `allowPrivilegeEscalation=false` sangat disarankan dengan strategi ini.
- _RunAsAny_ - Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang diberikan. Mengizinkan `runAsUser` apapun untuk digunakan.

**RunAsGroup** - Mengatur ID grup primer mana yang digunakan untuk menjalankan Container-container.

- _MustRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Menggunakan semua nilai minimum dari `range` yang pertama sebagai nilai bawaannya. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range`.
- _MayRunAs_ - Tidak memerlukan `RunAsGroup` untuk diperinci. Tetapi, saat `RunAsGroup` diperinci, mereka harus berada pada `range` yang didefinisikan.
- _RunAsAny_ - Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang diberikan. Mengizinkan `runAsGroup` apapun untuk digunakan.

**SupplementalGroups** - Mengatur ID grup mana saja yang ditambah ke Container-container.

- _MustRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Menggunakan semua nilai minimum dari `range` yang pertama sebagai nilai bawaannya. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range`.
- _MayRunAs_ - Membutuhkan setidaknya satu `range` untuk dapat ditentukan. Mengizinkan `supplementalGroups` dibiarkan kosong tanpa memberikan nilai bawaan. Memvalidasikan terhadap semua `range` jika nilai `supplementalGroup` disetel.
- _RunAsAny_ - Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang diberikan. Mengizinkan ID `supplementalGroups` apapun untuk digunakan.

### Eskalasi _Privilege_

Opsi ini mengatur opsi Container `allowPrivilegeEscalation`. Nilai `bool` ini secara langsung mengatur apakah _flag_ [`no_new_privs`](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/prctl/no_new_privs.txt) disetel pada proses Container tersebut. _Flag_ ini akan mencegah program `setuid` mengganti ID pengguna efektif, dan mencegah berkas-berkas untuk memungkinkan kemampuan tambahan (misalnya, ini akan mencagah penggunaan peralatan `ping`). Perilaku ini dibutuhkan untuk memaksakan `MustRunAsNonRoot`.

**AllowPrivilegeEscalation** - Membatasi apakah seorang pengguna diizinkan untuk menyetel konteks keamanan dari sebuah Container menjadi `allowPrivilegeEscalation=true`. Hal ini memiliki nilai bawaan untuk diizinkan, agar tidak merusak program `setuid`. Menyetel ini menjadi `false` memastikan bahwa tidak ada proses _child_ dari sebuah Container dapat memperoleh lebih banyak _privilege_ dari _parent_-nya.

**DefaultAllowPrivilegeEscalation** - Menyetel nilai bawaan untuk opsi `allowPrivilegeEscalation`. Perilaku bawaan tanpa hal ini adalah untuk mengizinkan eskalasi _privilege_ agar tidak merusak program `setuid`. Jika perilaku ini tidak diinginkan, kolom ini dapat digunakan untuk menyetel nilai bawaan `allowPrivilegeEscalation` agar melarang eskalasi, sementara masih mengizinkan Pod-Pod untuk meminta `allowPrivilegeEscalation` secara eksplisit.

### Kemampuan-kemampuan

Kemampuan-kemampuan Linux menyediakan perincian yang detail dari _privilege-privilege_ yang biasa dikaitkan dengan `superuser`. Beberapa dari kemampuan-kemampuan ini dapat digunakan untuk mengeskalasi _privilege-privilege_ atau untuk _container breakout_, dan dapat dibatasi oleh PodSecurityPolicy. Untuk lebih lanjut tentang kemampuan-kemampuan Linux, lihat [capabilities(7)](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html).

Kolom-kolom berikut mengambil daftar kemampuan-kemampuan, diperincikan sebagai nama kemampuannya dalam ALL_CAPS tanpa awalan `CAP_`.

**AllowedCapabilities** - Menyediakan sebuah daftar putih dari kemampuan-kemampuan yang dapat ditambahkan pada sebuah Container. Kumpulan kemampuan bawaan secara implisit diizinkan. Kumpulan kosong berarti tidak ada kemampuan tambahan yang dapat ditambahkan selain bawaannya. `*` dapat digunakan untuk mengizinkan semua kemampuan.

**RequiredDropCapabilities** - Kemampuan-kemampuan yang harus dihapus dari Container-container. Kemampuan-kemampuan ini dihapus dari kumpulan bawaan, dan tidak boleh ditambahkan. Kemampuan-kemampuan yang terdaftar di `RequiredDropCapabilities` tidak boleh termasuk di dalam `AllowedCapabilities` atau `DefaultAddCapabilities`.

**DefaultAddCapabilities** - Kemampuan-kemampuan yang ditambahkan pada Container-container secara bawaan, sebagai tambahan untuk bawaan _runtime_. Lihat [dokumentasi Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities) untuk daftar kemampuan bawaan saat menggunakan _runtime_ Docker.

### SELinux

- _MustRunAs_ - Mengharuskan penyetelan `seLinuxOptions`. Menggunakan `seLinuxOptions` sebagai nilai bawaannya. Memvalidasi terhadap `seLinuxOptions`.
- _RunAsAny_ - Tidak ada nilai bawaan yang disediakan. Mengizinkan nilai `seLinuxOptions` apapun untuk diberikan.

### AllowedProcMountTypes

`allowedProcMountTypes` adalah sebuah daftar putih dari ProcMountType yang diizinkan. Nilai kosong atau `nil` menunjukkan bahwa hanya `DefaultProcMountType` yang boleh digunakan.

`DefaultProcMount` menggunakan nilai bawaan _container runtime_ untuk _readonly_ dan _masked paths_ untuk `/proc`. Kebanyakan _runtime_ Container melakukan _mask_ terhadap beberapa _path_ di dalam `/proc` untuk menghindari _security exposure_ dari perangkat-perangkat atau informasi khusus yang tidak disengaja. Hal ini ditandai dengan nilai _string_ `Default`.

Satu-satunya ProcMountType lainnya adalah `UnmaskedProcMount`, yang melangkahi perilaku _masking_ bawaan dari _runtime_ Container dan memastikan bahwa `/proc` yang baru dibuat tetap utuh tanpa perubahan. Hal ini ditandai dengan nilai _string_ `Unmasked`.

### AppArmor

Diatur melalui anotasi pada PodSecurityPolicy. Lihat [dokumentasi AppArmor](/docs/tutorials/clusters/apparmor/#podsecuritypolicy-annotations).

### Seccomp

Penggunaan profil-profil _seccomp_ di dalam Pod-Pod dapat diatur melalui anotasi pada PodSecurityPolicy.
_Seccomp_ adalah fitur _Alpha_ di Kubernetes.

**seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/defaultProfileName** - Anotasi yang menunjukkan profil _seccomp_ bawaan untuk diterapkan kepada container-container. Nilai-nilai yang mungkin adalah:

- `unconfined` - _Seccomp_ tidak diterapkan pada proses-proses di container (ini adalah bawaan di Kubernetes), jika tidak ada alternatif yang diberikan.
- `runtime/default` - Profil _runtime_ container bawaan digunakan.
- `docker/default` - Profil bawaan _seccomp_ Docker digunakan. Sudah kedaluwarsa sejak Kubernetes 1.11. Gunakan `runtime/default` sebagai gantinya.
- `localhost/<path>` - Menentukan sebuah profil sebagai sebuah berkas pada Node yang berlokasi pada `<seccomp_root>/<path>`, di mana `<seccomp_root>` didefinisikan melalui _flag_ `--seccomp-profile-root` pada Kubelet.

**seccomp.security.alpha.kubernetes.io/allowedProfileNames** - Anotasi yang menunjukkan nilai-nilai mana yang diizinkan untuk anotasi _seccomp_ pada Pod. Ditentukan sebagai sebuah daftar nilai yang diizinkan yang dibatasi dengan tanda koma. Nilai-nilai yang dimungkinkan adalah yang terdaftar di atas, ditambah dengan `*` untuk mengizinkan semua profil. Ketiadaan anotasi ini berarti nilai bawaannya tidak dapat diubah.

### Sysctl

Secara bawaan, semua _sysctl_ yang aman diizinkan.

- `forbiddenSysctls` - mengecualikan _sysctl-sysctl_ tertentu. Kamu dapat melarang kombinasi dari _sysctl-sysctl_ yang aman maupun tidak aman pada daftar ini. Untuk melarang menyetel _sysctl_ apapun, gunakan nilai `*`.
- `allowedUnsafeSysctls` - mengizinkan _sysctl-sysctl_ tertentu yang telah dilarang oleh daftar bawaan, selama nilainya tidak terdaftar di dalam `forbiddenSysctls`.

Lihat [dokumentasi Sysctl](/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/sysctl-cluster/#podsecuritypolicy).

title: Pod Security Standards
description: >
  A detailed look at the different policy levels defined in the Pod Security Standards.
content_type: concept
weight: 10
---

<!-- overview -->

The Pod Security Standards define three different _policies_ to broadly cover the security
spectrum. These policies are _cumulative_ and range from highly-permissive to highly-restrictive.
This guide outlines the requirements of each policy.

| Profile | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| <strong style=""white-space: nowrap"">Privileged</strong> | Unrestricted policy, providing the widest possible level of permissions. This policy allows for known privilege escalations. |
| <strong style=""white-space: nowrap"">Baseline</strong> | Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration. |
| <strong style=""white-space: nowrap"">Restricted</strong> | Heavily restricted policy, following current Pod hardening best practices. |

<!-- body -->

## Profile Details

### Privileged

**The _Privileged_ policy is purposely-open, and entirely unrestricted.** This type of policy is
typically aimed at system- and infrastructure-level workloads managed by privileged, trusted users.

The Privileged policy is defined by an absence of restrictions. Allow-by-default
mechanisms (such as gatekeeper) may be Privileged by default. In contrast, for a deny-by-default mechanism (such as Pod
Security Policy) the Privileged policy should disable all restrictions.

### Baseline

**The _Baseline_ policy is aimed at ease of adoption for common containerized workloads while
preventing known privilege escalations.** This policy is targeted at application operators and
developers of non-critical applications. The following listed controls should be
enforced/disallowed:

{{< note >}}
In this table, wildcards (`*`) indicate all elements in a list. For example,
`spec.containers[*].securityContext` refers to the Security Context object for _all defined
containers_. If any of the listed containers fails to meet the requirements, the entire pod will
fail validation.

### Restricted

**The _Restricted_ policy is aimed at enforcing current Pod hardening best practices, at the
expense of some compatibility.** It is targeted at operators and developers of security-critical
applications, as well as lower-trust users. The following listed controls should be
enforced/disallowed:

{{< note >}}
In this table, wildcards (`*`) indicate all elements in a list. For example, 
`spec.containers[*].securityContext` refers to the Security Context object for _all defined
containers_. If any of the listed containers fails to meet the requirements, the entire pod will
fail validation.

## Policy Instantiation

Decoupling policy definition from policy instantiation allows for a common understanding and
consistent language of policies across clusters, independent of the underlying enforcement
mechanism.

As mechanisms mature, they will be defined below on a per-policy basis. The methods of enforcement
of individual policies are not defined here.

[**Pod Security Admission Controller**](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)

- {{< example file=""security/podsecurity-privileged.yaml"" >}}Privileged namespace{{< /example >}}
- {{< example file=""security/podsecurity-baseline.yaml"" >}}Baseline namespace{{< /example >}}
- {{< example file=""security/podsecurity-restricted.yaml"" >}}Restricted namespace{{< /example >}}

### Alternatives

{{% thirdparty-content %}}

Other alternatives for enforcing policies are being developed in the Kubernetes ecosystem, such as: 

- [Kubewarden](https://github.com/kubewarden)
- [Kyverno](https://kyverno.io/policies/pod-security/)
- [OPA Gatekeeper](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/gatekeeper)

## Pod OS field

Kubernetes lets you use nodes that run either Linux or Windows. You can mix both kinds of
node in one cluster.
Windows in Kubernetes has some limitations and differentiators from Linux-based
workloads. Specifically, many of the Pod `securityContext` fields
[have no effect on Windows](/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers-securitycontext).

{{< note >}}
Kubelets prior to v1.24 don\'t enforce the pod OS field, and if a cluster has nodes on versions earlier than v1.24 the restricted policies should be pinned to a version prior to v1.25.
{{< /note >}}

### Restricted Pod Security Standard changes
Another important change, made in Kubernetes v1.25 is that the  _restricted_ Pod security
has been updated to use the `pod.spec.os.name` field. Based on the OS name, certain policies that are specific
to a particular OS can be relaxed for the other OS.


#### OS-specific policy controls
Restrictions on the following controls are only required if `.spec.os.name` is not `windows`:
- Privilege Escalation
- Seccomp
- Linux Capabilities

## FAQ

### Why isn\'t there a profile between privileged and baseline?

The three profiles defined here have a clear linear progression from most secure (restricted) to least
secure (privileged), and cover a broad set of workloads. Privileges required above the baseline
policy are typically very application specific, so we do not offer a standard profile in this
niche. This is not to say that the privileged profile should always be used in this case, but that
policies in this space need to be defined on a case-by-case basis.

SIG Auth may reconsider this position in the future, should a clear need for other profiles arise.

### What\'s the difference between a security profile and a security context?

[Security Contexts](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) configure Pods and
Containers at runtime. Security contexts are defined as part of the Pod and container specifications
in the Pod manifest, and represent parameters to the container runtime.

Security profiles are control plane mechanisms to enforce specific settings in the Security Context,
as well as other related parameters outside the Security Context. As of July 2021, 
[Pod Security Policies](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-policy/) are deprecated in favor of the
built-in [Pod Security Admission Controller](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/). 


### What about sandboxed Pods?

There is not currently an API standard that controls whether a Pod is considered sandboxed or
not. Sandbox Pods may be identified by the use of a sandboxed runtime (such as gVisor or Kata
Containers), but there is no standard definition of what a sandboxed runtime is.

The protections necessary for sandboxed workloads can differ from others. For example, the need to
restrict privileged permissions is lessened when the workload is isolated from the underlying
kernel. This allows for workloads requiring heightened permissions to still be isolated.

Additionally, the protection of sandboxed workloads is highly dependent on the method of
sandboxing. As such, no single recommended profile is recommended for all sandboxed workloads.

<!-- overview -->

<!--
The Pod Security Standards define three different _policies_ to broadly cover the security
spectrum. These policies are _cumulative_ and range from highly-permissive to highly-restrictive.
This guide outlines the requirements of each policy.

### Privileged

<!--
**The _Privileged_ policy is purposely-open, and entirely unrestricted.** This type of policy is
typically aimed at system- and infrastructure-level workloads managed by privileged, trusted users.

The Privileged policy is defined by an absence of restrictions. Allow-by-default
mechanisms (such as gatekeeper) may be Privileged by default. In contrast, for a deny-by-default mechanism (such as Pod
Security Policy) the Privileged policy should disable all restrictions.

## Policy Instantiation

Decoupling policy definition from policy instantiation allows for a common understanding and
consistent language of policies across clusters, independent of the underlying enforcement
mechanism.

As mechanisms mature, they will be defined below on a per-policy basis. The methods of enforcement
of individual policies are not defined here.

## Pod OS field

Kubernetes lets you use nodes that run either Linux or Windows. You can mix both kinds of
node in one cluster.
Windows in Kubernetes has some limitations and differentiators from Linux-based
workloads. Specifically, many of the Pod `securityContext` fields
[have no effect on Windows](/docs/concepts/windows/intro/#compatibility-v1-pod-spec-containers-securitycontext).

### Restricted Pod Security Standard changes
Another important change, made in Kubernetes v1.25 is that the  _restricted_ Pod security
has been updated to use the `pod.spec.os.name` field. Based on the OS name, certain policies that are specific
to a particular OS can be relaxed for the other OS.

<!--
The three profiles defined here have a clear linear progression from most secure (restricted) to least
secure (privileged), and cover a broad set of workloads. Privileges required above the baseline
policy are typically very application specific, so we do not offer a standard profile in this
niche. This is not to say that the privileged profile should always be used in this case, but that
policies in this space need to be defined on a case-by-case basis.

SIG Auth may reconsider this position in the future, should a clear need for other profiles arise.

### What\'s the difference between a security profile and a security context?

[Security Contexts](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/) configure Pods and
Containers at runtime. Security contexts are defined as part of the Pod and container specifications
in the Pod manifest, and represent parameters to the container runtime.

### What about sandboxed Pods?

There is not currently an API standard that controls whether a Pod is considered sandboxed or
not. Sandbox Pods may be identified by the use of a sandboxed runtime (such as gVisor or Kata
Containers), but there is no standard definition of what a sandboxed runtime is.

<!--
The protections necessary for sandboxed workloads can differ from others. For example, the need to
restrict privileged permissions is lessened when the workload is isolated from the underlying
kernel. This allows for workloads requiring heightened permissions to still be isolated.

Additionally, the protection of sandboxed workloads is highly dependent on the method of
sandboxing. As such, no single recommended profile is recommended for all sandboxed workloads.

<!--
Checklists are **not** sufficient for attaining a good security posture on their
own. A good security posture requires constant attention and improvement, but a
checklist can be the first step on the never-ending journey towards security
preparedness. Some of the recommendations in this checklist may be too
restrictive or too lax for your specific security needs. Since Kubernetes
security is not ""one size fits all"", each category of checklist items should be
evaluated on its merits.

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] `system:masters` group is not used for user or component authentication after bootstrapping.
- [ ] The kube-controller-manager is running with `--use-service-account-credentials`
  enabled.
- [ ] The root certificate is protected (either an offline CA, or a managed
  online CA with effective access controls).
- [ ] Intermediate and leaf certificates have an expiry date no more than 3
  years in the future.
- [ ] A process exists for periodic access review, and reviews occur no more
  than 24 months apart.
- [ ] The [Role Based Access Control Good Practices](/docs/concepts/security/rbac-good-practices/)
  is followed for guidance related to authentication and authorization.

After bootstrapping, neither users nor components should authenticate to the
Kubernetes API as `system:masters`. Similarly, running all of
kube-controller-manager as `system:masters` should be avoided. In fact,
`system:masters` should only be used as a break-glass mechanism, as opposed to
an admin user.

## Network security

- [ ] CNI plugins in-use supports network policies.
- [ ] Ingress and egress network policies are applied to all workloads in the
  cluster.
- [ ] Default network policies within each namespace, selecting all pods, denying
  everything, are in place.
- [ ] If appropriate, a service mesh is used to encrypt all communications inside of the cluster.
- [ ] The Kubernetes API, kubelet API and etcd are not exposed publicly on Internet.
- [ ] Access from the workloads to the cloud metadata API is filtered.
- [ ] Use of LoadBalancer and ExternalIPs is restricted.

<!--
A number of [Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)
plugins provide the functionality to
restrict network resources that pods may communicate with. This is most commonly done
through [Network Policies](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
which provide a namespaced resource to define rules. Default network policies
blocking everything egress and ingress, in each namespace, selecting all the
pods, can be useful to adopt an allow list approach, ensuring that no workloads
is missed.

Not all CNI plugins provide encryption in transit. If the chosen plugin lacks this
feature, an alternative solution could be to use a service mesh to provide that
functionality.

The etcd datastore of the control plane should have controls to limit access and
not be publicly exposed on the Internet. Furthermore, mutual TLS (mTLS) should
be used to communicate securely with it. The certificate authority for this
should be unique to etcd.

External Internet access to the Kubernetes API server should be restricted to
not expose the API publicly. Be careful as many managed Kubernetes distribution
are publicly exposing the API server by default. You can then use a bastion host
to access the server.

The [kubelet](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) API access
should be restricted and not publicly exposed, the defaults authentication and
authorization settings, when no configuration file specified with the `--config`
flag, are overly permissive.

<!--
The [Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
define three different policies, privileged, baseline and restricted that limit
how fields can be set in the `PodSpec` regarding security.
These standards can be enforced at the namespace level with the new
[Pod Security](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) admission,
enabled by default, or by third-party admission webhook. Please note that,
contrary to the removed PodSecurityPolicy admission it replaces,
[Pod Security](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)
admission can be easily combined with admission webhooks and external services.

Pod Security admission `restricted` policy, the most restrictive policy of the
[Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) set,
[can operate in several modes](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#pod-security-admission-labels-for-namespaces),
`warn`, `audit` or `enforce` to gradually apply the most appropriate
[security context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
according to security best practices. Nevertheless, pods\'
[security context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
should be separately investigated to limit the privileges and access pods may
have on top of the predefined security standards, for specific use cases.

[Memory and CPU limits](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
should be set in order to restrict the memory and CPU resources a pod can
consume on a node, and therefore prevent potential DoS attacks from malicious or
breached workloads. Such policy can be enforced by an admission controller.
Please note that CPU limits will throttle usage and thus can have unintended
effects on auto-scaling features or efficiency i.e. running the process in best
effort with the CPU resource available.

### Enabling Seccomp

Seccomp can improve the security of your workloads by reducing the Linux kernel
syscall attack surface available inside containers. The seccomp filter mode
leverages BPF to create an allow or deny list of specific syscalls, named
profiles. Those seccomp profiles can be enabled on individual workloads,
[a security tutorial is available](/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/). In
addition, the [Kubernetes Security Profiles Operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator)
is a project to facilitate the management and use of seccomp in clusters.

For historical context, please note that Docker has been using
[a default seccomp profile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/)
to only allow a restricted set of syscalls since 2016 from
[Docker Engine 1.10](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-engine-1-10-security/),
but Kubernetes is still not confining workloads by default. The default seccomp
profile can be found [in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go)
as well. Fortunately, [Seccomp Default](/blog/2021/08/25/seccomp-default/), a
new alpha feature to use a default seccomp profile for all workloads can now be

#### AppArmor

<!--
[AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) is a Linux kernel security module that can
provide an easy way to implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and better
auditing through system logs. To [enable AppArmor in Kubernetes](/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/),
at least version 1.4 is required. Like seccomp, AppArmor is also configured
through profiles, where each profile is either running in enforcing mode, which
blocks access to disallowed resources or complain mode, which only reports
violations. AppArmor profiles are enforced on a per-container basis, with an
annotation, allowing for processes to gain just the right privileges.

Pods that are on different tiers of sensitivity, for example, an application pod
and the Kubernetes API server, should be deployed onto separate nodes. The
purpose of node isolation is to prevent an application container breakout to
directly providing access to applications with higher level of sensitivity to easily
pivot within the cluster. This separation should be enforced to prevent pods
accidentally being deployed onto the same node. This could be enforced with the
following features:

Pods needing secrets should have these automatically mounted through volumes,
preferably stored in memory like with the [`emptyDir.medium` option](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).
Mechanism can be used to also inject secrets from third-party storages as
volume, like the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/).
This should be done preferentially as compared to providing the pods service
account RBAC access to secrets. This would allow adding secrets into the pod as
environment variables or files. Please note that the environment variable method
might be more prone to leakage due to crash dumps in logs and the
non-confidential nature of environment variable in Linux, as opposed to the
permission mechanism on files.

## Images

- [ ] Minimize unnecessary content in container images.
- [ ] Container images are configured to be run as unprivileged user.
- [ ] References to container images are made by sha256 digests (rather than
tags) or the provenance of the image is validated by verifying the image\'s
digital signature at deploy time [via admission control](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/#verifying-image-signatures-with-admission-controller).
- [ ] Container images are regularly scanned during creation and in deployment, and
  known vulnerable software is patched.

Build images to directly start with an unprivileged user by using the
[`USER` instruction in Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user).
The [Security Context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod)
allows a container image to be started with a specific user and group with
`runAsUser` and `runAsGroup`, even if not specified in the image manifest.
However, the file permissions in the image layers might make it impossible to just
start the process with a new unprivileged user without image modification.

Avoid using image tags to reference an image, especially the `latest` tag, the
image behind a tag can be easily modified in a registry. Prefer using the
complete `sha256` digest which is unique to the image manifest. This policy can be
enforced via an [ImagePolicyWebhook](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#imagepolicywebhook).
Image signatures can also be automatically [verified with an admission controller](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/#verifying-image-signatures-with-admission-controller)
at deploy time to validate their authenticity and integrity.

<!--
Scanning a container image can prevent critical vulnerabilities from being
deployed to the cluster alongside the container image. Image scanning should be
completed before deploying a container image to a cluster and is usually done
as part of the deployment process in a CI/CD pipeline. The purpose of an image
scan is to obtain information about possible vulnerabilities and their
prevention in the container image, such as a
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/)
score. If the result of the image scans is combined with the pipeline
compliance rules, only properly patched container images will end up in
Production.

title: Security Checklist
description: >
  Baseline checklist for ensuring security in Kubernetes clusters.
content_type: concept
weight: 100
---

<!-- overview -->

This checklist aims at providing a basic list of guidance with links to more
comprehensive documentation on each topic. It does not claim to be exhaustive
and is meant to evolve.

On how to read and use this document:

- The order of topics does not reflect an order of priority.
- Some checklist items are detailed in the paragraph below the list of each section.

{{< caution >}}
Checklists are **not** sufficient for attaining a good security posture on their
own. A good security posture requires constant attention and improvement, but a
checklist can be the first step on the never-ending journey towards security
preparedness. Some of the recommendations in this checklist may be too
restrictive or too lax for your specific security needs. Since Kubernetes
security is not ""one size fits all"", each category of checklist items should be
evaluated on its merits.
{{< /caution >}}

<!-- body -->

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] `system:masters` group is not used for user or component authentication after bootstrapping.
- [ ] The kube-controller-manager is running with `--use-service-account-credentials`
  enabled.
- [ ] The root certificate is protected (either an offline CA, or a managed
  online CA with effective access controls).
- [ ] Intermediate and leaf certificates have an expiry date no more than 3
  years in the future.
- [ ] A process exists for periodic access review, and reviews occur no more
  than 24 months apart.
- [ ] The [Role Based Access Control Good Practices](/docs/concepts/security/rbac-good-practices/)
  is followed for guidance related to authentication and authorization.

After bootstrapping, neither users nor components should authenticate to the
Kubernetes API as `system:masters`. Similarly, running all of
kube-controller-manager as `system:masters` should be avoided. In fact,
`system:masters` should only be used as a break-glass mechanism, as opposed to
an admin user.

## Network security

- [ ] CNI plugins in-use supports network policies.
- [ ] Ingress and egress network policies are applied to all workloads in the
  cluster.
- [ ] Default network policies within each namespace, selecting all pods, denying
  everything, are in place.
- [ ] If appropriate, a service mesh is used to encrypt all communications inside of the cluster.
- [ ] The Kubernetes API, kubelet API and etcd are not exposed publicly on Internet.
- [ ] Access from the workloads to the cloud metadata API is filtered.
- [ ] Use of LoadBalancer and ExternalIPs is restricted.

A number of [Container Network Interface (CNI) plugins](/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/compute-storage-net/network-plugins/)
plugins provide the functionality to
restrict network resources that pods may communicate with. This is most commonly done
through [Network Policies](/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/)
which provide a namespaced resource to define rules. Default network policies
blocking everything egress and ingress, in each namespace, selecting all the
pods, can be useful to adopt an allow list approach, ensuring that no workloads
is missed.

Not all CNI plugins provide encryption in transit. If the chosen plugin lacks this
feature, an alternative solution could be to use a service mesh to provide that
functionality.

The etcd datastore of the control plane should have controls to limit access and
not be publicly exposed on the Internet. Furthermore, mutual TLS (mTLS) should
be used to communicate securely with it. The certificate authority for this
should be unique to etcd.

External Internet access to the Kubernetes API server should be restricted to
not expose the API publicly. Be careful as many managed Kubernetes distribution
are publicly exposing the API server by default. You can then use a bastion host
to access the server.

The [kubelet](/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) API access
should be restricted and not publicly exposed, the defaults authentication and
authorization settings, when no configuration file specified with the `--config`
flag, are overly permissive.

If a cloud provider is used for hosting Kubernetes, the access from pods to the cloud
metadata API `169.254.169.254` should also be restricted or blocked if not needed
because it may leak information.

For restricted LoadBalancer and ExternalIPs use, see
[CVE-2020-8554: Man in the middle using LoadBalancer or ExternalIPs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/97076)
and the [DenyServiceExternalIPs admission controller](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips)
for further information.
## Pod security

- [ ] RBAC rights to `create`, `update`, `patch`, `delete` workloads is only granted if necessary.
- [ ] Appropriate Pod Security Standards policy is applied for all namespaces and enforced.
- [ ] Memory limit is set for the workloads with a limit equal or inferior to the request.
- [ ] CPU limit might be set on sensitive workloads.
- [ ] For nodes that support it, Seccomp is enabled with appropriate syscalls
  profile for programs.
- [ ] For nodes that support it, AppArmor or SELinux is enabled with appropriate
  profile for programs.

RBAC authorization is crucial but
[cannot be granular enough to have authorization on the Pods\' resources](/docs/concepts/security/rbac-good-practices/#workload-creation)
(or on any resource that manages Pods). The only granularity is the API verbs
on the resource itself, for example, `create` on Pods. Without
additional admission, the authorization to create these resources allows direct
unrestricted access to the schedulable nodes of a cluster.

The [Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/)
define three different policies, privileged, baseline and restricted that limit
how fields can be set in the `PodSpec` regarding security.
These standards can be enforced at the namespace level with the new
[Pod Security](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/) admission,
enabled by default, or by third-party admission webhook. Please note that,
contrary to the removed PodSecurityPolicy admission it replaces,
[Pod Security](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/)
admission can be easily combined with admission webhooks and external services.

Pod Security admission `restricted` policy, the most restrictive policy of the
[Pod Security Standards](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/) set,
[can operate in several modes](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/#pod-security-admission-labels-for-namespaces),
`warn`, `audit` or `enforce` to gradually apply the most appropriate
[security context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
according to security best practices. Nevertheless, pods\'
[security context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/)
should be separately investigated to limit the privileges and access pods may
have on top of the predefined security standards, for specific use cases.

For a hands-on tutorial on [Pod Security](/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-admission/),
see the blog post
[Kubernetes 1.23: Pod Security Graduates to Beta](/blog/2021/12/09/pod-security-admission-beta/).

[Memory and CPU limits](/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/)
should be set in order to restrict the memory and CPU resources a pod can
consume on a node, and therefore prevent potential DoS attacks from malicious or
breached workloads. Such policy can be enforced by an admission controller.
Please note that CPU limits will throttle usage and thus can have unintended
effects on auto-scaling features or efficiency i.e. running the process in best
effort with the CPU resource available.

{{< caution >}}
Memory limit superior to request can expose the whole node to OOM issues.
{{< /caution >}}

### Enabling Seccomp

Seccomp can improve the security of your workloads by reducing the Linux kernel
syscall attack surface available inside containers. The seccomp filter mode
leverages BPF to create an allow or deny list of specific syscalls, named
profiles. Those seccomp profiles can be enabled on individual workloads,
[a security tutorial is available](/docs/tutorials/security/seccomp/). In
addition, the [Kubernetes Security Profiles Operator](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/security-profiles-operator)
is a project to facilitate the management and use of seccomp in clusters.

For historical context, please note that Docker has been using
[a default seccomp profile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/seccomp/)
to only allow a restricted set of syscalls since 2016 from
[Docker Engine 1.10](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-engine-1-10-security/),
but Kubernetes is still not confining workloads by default. The default seccomp
profile can be found [in containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/blob/main/contrib/seccomp/seccomp_default.go)
as well. Fortunately, [Seccomp Default](/blog/2021/08/25/seccomp-default/), a
new alpha feature to use a default seccomp profile for all workloads can now be
enabled and tested.

{{< note >}}
Seccomp is only available on Linux nodes.
{{< /note >}}

### Enabling AppArmor or SELinux

#### AppArmor

[AppArmor](https://apparmor.net/) is a Linux kernel security module that can
provide an easy way to implement Mandatory Access Control (MAC) and better
auditing through system logs. To [enable AppArmor in Kubernetes](/docs/tutorials/security/apparmor/),
at least version 1.4 is required. Like seccomp, AppArmor is also configured
through profiles, where each profile is either running in enforcing mode, which
blocks access to disallowed resources or complain mode, which only reports
violations. AppArmor profiles are enforced on a per-container basis, with an
annotation, allowing for processes to gain just the right privileges.

{{< note >}}
AppArmor is only available on Linux nodes, and enabled in
[some Linux distributions](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/home#distributions-and-ports).
{{< /note >}}

#### SELinux

[SELinux](https://github.com/SELinuxProject/selinux-notebook/blob/main/src/selinux_overview.md) is also a
Linux kernel security module that can provide a mechanism for supporting access
control security policies, including Mandatory Access Controls (MAC). SELinux
labels can be assigned to containers or pods
[via their `securityContext` section](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#assign-selinux-labels-to-a-container).

{{< note >}}
SELinux is only available on Linux nodes, and enabled in
[some Linux distributions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security-Enhanced_Linux#Implementations).
{{< /note >}}

## Pod placement

- [ ] Pod placement is done in accordance with the tiers of sensitivity of the
  application.
- [ ] Sensitive applications are running isolated on nodes or with specific
  sandboxed runtimes.

Pods that are on different tiers of sensitivity, for example, an application pod
and the Kubernetes API server, should be deployed onto separate nodes. The
purpose of node isolation is to prevent an application container breakout to
directly providing access to applications with higher level of sensitivity to easily
pivot within the cluster. This separation should be enforced to prevent pods
accidentally being deployed onto the same node. This could be enforced with the
following features:

[Node Selectors](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/)
: Key-value pairs, as part of the pod specification, that specify which nodes to
deploy onto. These can be enforced at the namespace and cluster level with the
[PodNodeSelector](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podnodeselector)
admission controller.

[PodTolerationRestriction](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podtolerationrestriction)
: An admission controller that allows administrators to restrict permitted
[tolerations](/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/taint-and-toleration/) within a
namespace. Pods within a namespace may only utilize the tolerations specified on
the namespace object annotation keys that provide a set of default and allowed
tolerations.

[RuntimeClass](/docs/concepts/containers/runtime-class/)
: RuntimeClass is a feature for selecting the container runtime configuration.
The container runtime configuration is used to run a Pod\'s containers and can
provide more or less isolation from the host at the cost of performance
overhead.

## Secrets

- [ ] ConfigMaps are not used to hold confidential data.
- [ ] Encryption at rest is configured for the Secret API.
- [ ] If appropriate, a mechanism to inject secrets stored in third-party storage
  is deployed and available.
- [ ] Service account tokens are not mounted in pods that don\'t require them.
- [ ] [Bound service account token volume](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#bound-service-account-token-volume)
  is in-use instead of non-expiring tokens.

Secrets required for pods should be stored within Kubernetes Secrets as opposed
to alternatives such as ConfigMap. Secret resources stored within etcd should
be [encrypted at rest](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/encrypt-data/).

Pods needing secrets should have these automatically mounted through volumes,
preferably stored in memory like with the [`emptyDir.medium` option](/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir).
Mechanism can be used to also inject secrets from third-party storages as
volume, like the [Secrets Store CSI Driver](https://secrets-store-csi-driver.sigs.k8s.io/).
This should be done preferentially as compared to providing the pods service
account RBAC access to secrets. This would allow adding secrets into the pod as
environment variables or files. Please note that the environment variable method
might be more prone to leakage due to crash dumps in logs and the
non-confidential nature of environment variable in Linux, as opposed to the
permission mechanism on files.

Service account tokens should not be mounted into pods that do not require them. This can be configured by setting
[`automountServiceAccountToken`](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/#use-the-default-service-account-to-access-the-api-server)
to `false` either within the service account to apply throughout the namespace
or specifically for a pod. For Kubernetes v1.22 and above, use
[Bound Service Accounts](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#bound-service-account-token-volume)
for time-bound service account credentials.

## Images

- [ ] Minimize unnecessary content in container images.
- [ ] Container images are configured to be run as unprivileged user.
- [ ] References to container images are made by sha256 digests (rather than
tags) or the provenance of the image is validated by verifying the image\'s
digital signature at deploy time [via admission control](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/#verifying-image-signatures-with-admission-controller).
- [ ] Container images are regularly scanned during creation and in deployment, and
  known vulnerable software is patched.

Container image should contain the bare minimum to run the program they
package. Preferably, only the program and its dependencies, building the image
from the minimal possible base. In particular, image used in production should not
contain shells or debugging utilities, as an
[ephemeral debug container](/docs/tasks/debug/debug-application/debug-running-pod/#ephemeral-container)
can be used for troubleshooting.

Build images to directly start with an unprivileged user by using the
[`USER` instruction in Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/#user).
The [Security Context](/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/security-context/#set-the-security-context-for-a-pod)
allows a container image to be started with a specific user and group with
`runAsUser` and `runAsGroup`, even if not specified in the image manifest.
However, the file permissions in the image layers might make it impossible to just
start the process with a new unprivileged user without image modification.

Avoid using image tags to reference an image, especially the `latest` tag, the
image behind a tag can be easily modified in a registry. Prefer using the
complete `sha256` digest which is unique to the image manifest. This policy can be
enforced via an [ImagePolicyWebhook](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#imagepolicywebhook).
Image signatures can also be automatically [verified with an admission controller](/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/verify-signed-artifacts/#verifying-image-signatures-with-admission-controller)
at deploy time to validate their authenticity and integrity.

Scanning a container image can prevent critical vulnerabilities from being
deployed to the cluster alongside the container image. Image scanning should be
completed before deploying a container image to a cluster and is usually done
as part of the deployment process in a CI/CD pipeline. The purpose of an image
scan is to obtain information about possible vulnerabilities and their
prevention in the container image, such as a
[Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)](https://www.first.org/cvss/)
score. If the result of the image scans is combined with the pipeline
compliance rules, only properly patched container images will end up in
Production.

## Admission controllers

- [ ] An appropriate selection of admission controllers is enabled.
- [ ] A pod security policy is enforced by the Pod Security Admission or/and a
  webhook admission controller.
- [ ] The admission chain plugins and webhooks are securely configured.

Admission controllers can help to improve the security of the cluster. However,
they can present risks themselves as they extend the API server and
[should be properly secured](/blog/2022/01/19/secure-your-admission-controllers-and-webhooks/).

The following lists present a number of admission controllers that could be
considered to enhance the security posture of your cluster and application. It
includes controllers that may be referenced in other parts of this document.

This first group of admission controllers includes plugins
[enabled by default](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#which-plugins-are-enabled-by-default),
consider to leave them enabled unless you know what you are doing:

[`CertificateApproval`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#certificateapproval)
: Performs additional authorization checks to ensure the approving user has
permission to approve certificate request.

[`CertificateSigning`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#certificatesigning)
: Performs additional authorization checks to ensure the signing user has
permission to sign certificate requests.

[`CertificateSubjectRestriction`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#certificatesubjectrestriction)
: Rejects any certificate request that specifies a \'group\' (or \'organization
attribute\') of `system:masters`.

[`LimitRanger`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#limitranger)
: Enforce the LimitRange API constraints.

[`MutatingAdmissionWebhook`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook)
: Allows the use of custom controllers through webhooks, these controllers may
mutate requests that it reviews.

[`PodSecurity`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podsecurity)
: Replacement for Pod Security Policy, restricts security contexts of deployed
Pods.

[`ResourceQuota`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#resourcequota)
: Enforces resource quotas to prevent over-usage of resources.

[`ValidatingAdmissionWebhook`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#validatingadmissionwebhook)
: Allows the use of custom controllers through webhooks, these controllers do
not mutate requests that it reviews.

The second group includes plugin that are not enabled by default but in general
availability state and recommended to improve your security posture:

[`DenyServiceExternalIPs`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#denyserviceexternalips)
: Rejects all net-new usage of the `Service.spec.externalIPs` field. This is a mitigation for
[CVE-2020-8554: Man in the middle using LoadBalancer or ExternalIPs](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/97076).

[`NodeRestriction`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#noderestriction)
: Restricts kubelet\'s permissions to only modify the pods API resources they own
or the node API ressource that represent themselves. It also prevents kubelet
from using the `node-restriction.kubernetes.io/` annotation, which can be used
by an attacker with access to the kubelet\'s credentials to influence pod
placement to the controlled node.

The third group includes plugins that are not enabled by default but could be
considered for certain use cases:

[`AlwaysPullImages`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#alwayspullimages)
: Enforces the usage of the latest version of a tagged image and ensures that the deployer
has permissions to use the image.

[`ImagePolicyWebhook`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#imagepolicywebhook)
: Allows enforcing additional controls for images through webhooks.

<!-- The fourth group includes plugins that are not enabled by default, still in
alpha state but could be considered for certain use cases:

[`EventRateLimit`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#eventratelimit)
: Rate limits adding new Events to the API server.

[`PodNodeSelector`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podnodeselector)
: Allows controls of node selectors within namespaces and cluster-wide.

[`PodTolerationRestriction`](/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#podtolerationrestriction)
: Allows control of pod tolerations permitted for pods within a namespace. -->

Your organization has formal information security policies that cover the areas, and that you need to be aware of. You can access these policies in Aptible Gridiron, under My Gridiron Status.

In particular, be aware of the following:

*   **Data Classification Policy**: We bucket data into classification levels. Sensitive or regulated data, like PII, gets classified as \xe2\x80\x9cSensitive/Regulated.\xe2\x80\x9d
*   **Secure Information Handling Policy**: We handle information differently depending on the classification level, so sensitive data is treated more carefully.
*   **Technology Acceptable Use Policy**: Essentially, use work resources for work purposes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t circumvent or disable security controls, ever.
*   **Mobile Device Security Policy**: Rules and standards for laptops, workstations, and phones.
*   **Remote Access Policy**: Rules and standards for connecting to your organization's systems remotely.

If you have any questions, ask your Security Officer.

'","b""# Security Policy 

Thank you for auditing, testing, and/or blindly stumbling across a breaking bug or vulerability! Either way, thank you for coming forward instead of abusing it. No legal action will ever be taken against you by us as long as you are in line with the [Hacker1](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines) disclosure guidelines, and follow the rules layed out below!

1. **Report it as a vulnerability, NOT an issue.** Issues -> Create new Issue -> Report a security vulnerabulity. This keeps it confidental, and lets other affected people know of the vulnerability if they are in on it. This lets us work to fix it before anyone else can explot it. 
2. **Respect privacy.** Make a good faith effort not to access or destroy another user's data.
3. **Be patient.** Make a good faith effort to clarify and support their reports upon request. We have a team working on it, but we are currently a small set of people working on this as a passion project. 
4. **Do no harm.** Act for the common good through the prompt reporting of all found vulnerabilities. Never willfully exploit others without their permission.

Yup... thats it! 

In exchange, we promise to

1. **Resolve the issue** quickly, efficently, and transparerntly. While we are a small team, we do care about security very highly and it will become one of the highest priority issues. 
2. **Give proper regition**, if you would like, you can be in the contributers page, listed as a pentester, and have the specific vulnerabilites you found displayed with that. It's not much, but you deserve it!
3. **Do no harm**, if you responseibly disclose, we won't take any punative action against you or any collaborators. 

Unfortuntely, as we are a small team working as a passion project, **we are not currently able to offer monetary incestives** as rewards for major bugs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You may report security issues via email (see git commits) instead of a git issue (which everyone would have access to).

Note that this is a personal project developed in my free time. As such there is no reaction time guarantee, or any guarantee really that I have the ability to fix the issue in time.

However I will try my best to at least give you a response, and in case the issue affects my own code I will try to fix it as soon as possible. In case of third-party libraries I will try to get hold of an updated library, but of course no promise can be made when - or even if - such an updated library may become available.

This is a volunteer project, so updates will be made when possible.

From the ecosystem standpoint, we will strive to keep the dependencies in the application up to date.

From the application standpoint, security applies to the database, but not to the code.
This mostly relates to the licensure infrastructure in the application.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If there's issues with the application, please report them on The 3rd Library Discord.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe that you have found a vulnerability in jte, first please search the GitHub issues list (for both open and closed issues) to see if it has already been reported.

If it has not, then please contact Andreas Hager (andy at mazebert.com) directly. Please do not report any suspected vulnerabilities via GitHub issues as we wish to keep our users secure while a patch is implemented and deployed. This is because if this is reported as a GitHub issue, it more or less is equivalent to dropping a 0-day on all applications using jte. Instead, we encourage responsible disclosure.

If you wish to be acknowledged for finding the vulnerability, then please follow this process. Andreas will try to contact you within at least 5 business days, so when you post the email describing the vulnerability, please do so from an email address that you usually monitor. If you eventually wish to have it published as a CVE, we will also work with you to ensure that you are given proper credit with MITRE and NIST. Even if you do not wish to report the vulnerability as a CVE, we will acknowledge you when we create a GitHub issue (once the issue is patched) as well as acknowledging you in any security bulletin that we may write up and use to notify our users. (If you wish to have your identity remain unknown, or perhaps you email address, we can work with you on that as well.)

If possible, provide a working proof-of-concept or at least minimally describe how it can be exploited in sufficient details that we can understand what needs to be done to fix it. Unfortunately at this time, we are not in a position to pay out bug bounties for vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you'd like to warn me privately of a vulnerabilty, you can write me at robin.moisson on my protonmail.com address. I am attaching my GPG key at the end of this document, though it's not mandatory to use it.

If it's a more of a suggestion, or something that can be discussed openly without negative impact, you can also open an issue. Discussions on the security model and choices of StatiCrypt are very welcome!

In case of a severe vulnerability I'll try to get back to you quickly to acknowledge I got the message, and to get a fix out relatively quickly as well. 

There are periods in my life where I'm offline for weeks at a time, so unfortunately I can't guarantee a specific response speed at all times. Just know this might be what's happening if I'm completely unresponsive... It shouldn't last more than a month though.


And finally if you're reporting anything security related: thank you very much for making StatiCrypt safer, your benevolence is very much appreciated! \xf0\x9f\x99\x8f

Due to both time and resource constrains the Highlight.js core team fully supports only the current major/minor release of the library.  Prior major releases may be supported for a short time after new major releases are issued.  Problems with minor releases are often resolved by upgrading to the most recent minor release.

## Supported Versions

Generally speaking, Honeypot will be built on the current LTS version of Java *or* the minimum supported LTS version of Java for MC. Currently Honeypot is built on **Java 17**.

The latest minor release and all revisions of the plugin will get feature and security updates, the previous minor release and all revisions will get security updates, and anything older than that will not receive updates unless A) that version is still used on a susbstantial amount of servers (See [bstats](https://bstats.org/plugin/bukkit/Honeypot/15425)) and B) is vulnerable to a critical flaw (See [Log4j](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log4Shell), which luckily never *directly* affected Honeypot).

| Version       | Supported          | Support Given              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------- |
| 2.6.x         | :white_check_mark: | Feature & Security Updates |
| 2.5.x - 2.6.x | :white_check_mark: | Security Updates only      |
| < 2.5.x       | :x:                | No updates, update now!    |



## Reporting a Vulnerability

Reporting a vulnerability is extremely simple. [Click this link](https://github.com/TerrorByteTW/Honeypot/security/advisories/new) to open a new security advisory. This will be privately sent to the developers of Honeypot and will be reviewed as soon as received. If the flaw is deemed applicable, a fix will be released as soon as possible.

**DO NOT OPEN AN ISSUE FOR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES!** Not only will these be immediately closed and removed, but releasing information on security vulnerabilities without first attempting to notify the proper channels can be extremely detrimental to people who use this software. (See [SlickWraps Data Breach](https://web.archive.org/web/20200221151606/https://medium.com/@lynx0x00/i-hacked-slickwraps-this-is-how-8b0806358fbb). The person who discovered the breach ""sent a subtle tweet, anticipating that the \xe2\x80\x9cSecurity Researcher, White Hat Hacker\xe2\x80\x9d designation in \\[their\\] Twitter bio would be sufficient enough to spark a line of communication"" instead of properly disclosing it, causing others to attempt to breach SlickWraps as well).

Proper disclosure is crucial in these situations. I will do my absolute best to ensure security vulnerabilities are fixed, but doing so properly gives me the chance to fix it *before* it\'s abused.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
Please email security [at] mirror-networking.com to report a vulnerability.</br>
You can also contact us in [our Discord](https://discord.gg/N9QVxbM) for faster replies.

You can expect a reply within 24-48 hours.</br>
We will keep you updated on our steps to mitigate issues every 2-4 weeks.

## Timelines
- Critical vulnerabilities can be expected to be patched within 1-2 weeks.
- Medium risk vulnerabilities can be expected to be patched within 2-3 weeks.
- Low risk vulnerabilities will be patched within 3-4 weeks.

## Bug Bounty
Depending on the severity of the exploit, we offer a $50 - $500 bug bounty.

**Specifically we are looking for:**
* Ways to crash a Mirror server.
* Ways to exploit a Mirror server.
* Ways to leave a Mirror server in undefined state.

We are **not** looking for DOS/DDOS attacks, as those are expected to be handled by the hosting infrastructure. 

## Notifications
In case of security breaches, Mirror users will be informed in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/N9QVxbM) and release changelogs.
Since we collect no user data, you are recommended to read the changelog and follow our Discord announcements.

# Reporting a Vulnerability
In the first instance, send a detailed email to
[vos.security@openlinksw.com](mailto:vos.security@openlinksw.com)
to report a possible vulnerability in Virtuoso, even if you are
uncertain whether the issue in question is an exploitable vulnerability.

Please add as much detail as possible in your report, including:

 * version information from the binary using `virtuoso-t -?`
 * where you compiled/downloaded this binary from
 * short description (or script) to demonstrate the issue

You should receive an acknowledgement within a few business days,
which may include requests for additional details.

Followups, including notification of a relevant patch, will be sent
as appropriate.


## Supported Versions
Currently there is no official ""Long-Term Support"" version in Virtuoso.

New features as well as bug-fixes are regularly committed to the
[develop/7](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/tree/develop/7)
branch on GitHub.

At regular intervals we perform our due diligence and we close off this
development cycle by merging the work to the
[stable/7](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/tree/stable/7)
branch.

We then publish a
[new release](https://github.com/openlink/virtuoso-opensource/releases)
with ports for several key platforms.

## Introduction
This security policy outlines the expectations and procedures for reporting and resolving vulnerabilities in our GitHub repository. The security of our code is of utmost importance to us, and we appreciate the help of the community in identifying and reporting potential security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
If you believe you have discovered a vulnerability in our repository, please report it to us immediately by opening a new issue on our GitHub repository. When reporting a vulnerability, please include as much detail as possible, including a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce the vulnerability, and any relevant code snippets or screenshots.

## Response Time
We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 24 hours, and we will work to triage the issue within five business days of receiving your report. We will provide regular updates on the status of the vulnerability and our progress in addressing it.

## Vulnerability Assessment
We will review the reported vulnerability and assess the potential impact to our codebase and systems. If the vulnerability is confirmed, we will determine the severity of the issue and prioritize it accordingly.

## Fixing the Vulnerability
Once we have determined the severity of the vulnerability, we will work to address it as quickly as possible. We may contact you for additional information or assistance in reproducing the vulnerability, and we will keep you updated on our progress in fixing the issue.

## Disclosure
Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will publicly disclose the vulnerability and our response to it.

## Vulnerability Declined
In some cases, we may determine that a reported vulnerability is not a security issue or does not pose a significant risk to our systems. If we decline to address a reported vulnerability, we will explain our decision and provide our rationale for not taking action.

## Conclusion
We appreciate your assistance in helping to ensure the security of our codebase and systems. By working together, we can maintain a safe and secure environment for our users and customers.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security is very important to us.

If you have discovered a security issue, please contact miroslav.pejic.85@gmail.com directly. Please refrain from directly creating a GitHub issue and publicly disclosing the vulnerability.
We prefer a Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure (CVD) to properly understand and fix the root cause problem.

Your report should include:

-   Product version ([GitHub](https://github.com/miroslavpejic85/mirotalk/commits/master) commit hash or [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/mirotalk/p2p) sha256 digest hash)
-   The affected component if possible (client.js, server.js, etc.)
-   A vulnerability description
-   Reproduction steps

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.
The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

Thanks in advance for your support to make our products safer!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please review these guidelines before submitting a report. We take security seriously and do our best to resolve security issues as quickly as possible.

## Guidelines

While working to identify potential security vulnerabilities, we ask that you:

- Share any issues you discover with us via [our website](https://craftcms.com/contact) as soon as possible.
- Give us a reasonable amount of time to address any reported issues before publicizing them.
- Only report issues that are [in scope](#scope).
- Provide a quality report with precise explanations and concrete attack scenarios.
- Make sure you\xe2\x80\x99re aware of the versions of Craft and Commerce that are actively [receiving security fixes](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/supported-versions).

## Scope

We are only interested in vulnerabilities that affect Craft or [first party Craft plugins](https://github.com/craftcms), tested against **your own local installation of the software**. You can install a local copy of Craft by following these [installation instructions](https://craftcms.com/docs/installing). Do **not** test against any Craft installation that you don\xe2\x80\x99t own, including [craftcms.com](https://craftcms.com).

We are only interested in reports directly from the security researcher that discovered them, not from third-party bug bounty programs.

### Qualifying Vulnerabilities

- [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting)
- [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery)
- [Arbitrary Code Execution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution)
- [Privilege Escalation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Privilege_escalation)
- [SQL Injection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection)
- [Session Hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)

### Non-Qualifying Vulnerabilities

- Reports from automated tools or scanners
- Theoretical attacks without proof of exploitability
- Attacks that can be guarded against by following our [security recommendations](https://craftcms.com/knowledge-base/securing-craft).

# Configuring OCI security for DevOps

## Introduction

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) provides a comprehensive set of security mechanisms to control actions within tenancies. One core element of this approach is that security is enabled by default, so to take actions users need to be granted permissions. The tenancy admin of course has full capabilities when the tenancy is setup.

Even though tenancy admins may have full admin rights the DevOps service itself needs to be able to manage other resources, for example to run a build it needs a compute instance and to deploy it needs to be able issue commands against the deployment target (Functions, Kubernetes etc.) so we need to configure policies to allow this.

### Objectives

Using the OCI Cloud shell and Browser User Interface we will :

  - Create user group of users that will run the DevOps services
  
  - Define a policy allowing that group to run DevOps activities in a compartment
  
  - Create dynamic groups defining the DevOps service elements
  
  - Define policies allowing the DevOps service elements to manipulate other services within the compartment.
  
### Prerequisites

You will need to be a user with administrative rights to define policies, dynamic groups and create and manage user groups. If you are using a free trial then you will almost certainly be the admin of that tenancy and have full rights. If you are operating in a commercial or other tenancy then you may not have the admin rights, and may need to ask your tenancy administrator to configure the tenancy security as described below.

Setup a devops user group in the identity services

## Task 1: Gathering information

IMPORTANT unless otherwise told you **MUST** run the setup steps and actual devops lab in the same compartment as the OKE cluster.

If you are doing this lab in a free trial tenancy as part of an Oracle event then you will be the tenancy administrator so can do all of the following yourself, if however you are in a shared or paid tenancy then you may need to get the tenancy administrator (or someone who has the ability to make changed assigned to them) to do these steps. 

In the following instructions you will need to make some substitutions where you see `<YOUR INITIALS>` in the text please replace them with your initials **in lower case**, for example If you were named `John Smith` you\'d use `js`. If you think there will be multiple people using the same tennancy (in a lab using free trial accounts this is unlikely to be the case) with the same initials then please decide between yourselves on different ones to use. We do this so if you are running this lab in a shared tenancy then each user will have their own setup. If you used the scripts to create the environment these will have been the initials you used when running the `get-initials.sh` script.

You will also need to substitute `<compartment name>` with the name of the compartment you are using, in a lab using free trial accounts this is likely to be `CTDOKE` is however you are using a corporate or Oracle internal tenancy then this may be different. If you used the script to setup the environment this will be the name you gave to the `compartment-setup.sh` script.

Finally you will need to substitute `<Your Compartment OCID>` with the OCID of your compartment. If you used the scripts to setup the compartment you will have seen this in the `compartment-setup.sh` script output.

### Task 1a: Getting your compartments OCID

Compartment information is held with in the Identity and Access management service.

  1. Open the OCI Web console, Click on the ""Hamburger"" menu, then **Identity & Security** then **Compartments**
  
  ![](images/compartments-access-service.png)
  
  2. Locate your compartment in the list (`don\'t click on it) , If your compartment was created as a sub compartment of another you will need to navigate to it by clicking on the names in the hierarchy as if you were using a file manager.
  
  3. Click on the **OCID** for your compartment (for this list there are many compartments, I\'ve chosen the `CTDOKE` one as that was what I used when setting up the compartment in  the earlier instructions). A small popup will display the full OCID, click the **Copy** to copy it to your system
  
  ![](images/compartment-get-ocid.png)
  
  4. Save the OCID you\'ve just copied into a notepad or similar, you will need this later.
  

## Task 2: Defining a group of DevOps users

We need to define a group of users, we will later use this group to create a OCI Security policy that allows users to create, manage and use the Dev Ops service.

  1. Open the OCI Web console, Click on the ""shadow"" user icon on the upper right, note the user name that\'s displayed. In trhis case that\'s `oracleidentitycloudservice/tim.graves` but if you are the administrator of a trial tenancy (highly likely if you are in a Oracle guided lab) you\'re user name will will include your email address, for example `oracleidentitycloudservice/john.doe@somewhere.com`.
  
  ![](images/bui-shadow-person-menu-username.png)
  
  The next steps will be to create a devops group and assign your user to it. If you are in a free trial tenancy (where you are the administrator) then you can do this yourself, if however you are in a commercial tenancy or using a federated identity system you may not have the rights to do this, in which case you will need to get a the identity administrator to create the group and add you. 
  
  2. Click on the ""Hamburger"" menu, then **Identity & Security** then **Groups**
  
  ![](images/groups-access-service.png)
  
  Note that the tenancy I\'m using to get the images had a number of pre-existing groups, it\'s likely that a free trial tenancy will not, so ignore the other groups in the list shown here.
  
  3. Start creating the group - click the **Create Group** button

  ![](images/groups-initial-create.png)
  
  4. In the resulting ""popup"" form, In the **name** field name the group `<your initials>DevOpsUsersGroup` (so for me that would be `tgDevOpsUsersGroup`and in the **Description** put `Users allowed to run the DevOps service` (or anything else you like that describes the group) Click the **Create** button. The group will be created.
  
  ![](images/groups-create-form.png)
  
  5. Click on the newly created `DevOps` group in the list, then click the **Add User to Group** button
  
  ![](images/groups-add-members-initial.png)
  
  6. Click in the **Users** field, a list of all users will be shown, start typing your username and as you type the list will update to only include the matches, in this case I\'m using a different user name to show you how this works. **Click on your user from the list of options to select it**. In the image below the tenancy I\'m in has many pre-existing users, your user is going to be identified by the email address.
  
  ![](images/group-add-member-select-user.png)
  
  7. It is critical that you actually click on the user name in the list otherwise it won\'t be selected. Click on the **Add** button to add your user to the list.
  
  ![](*images/group-add-member-user-selected.png)
  
  Your user will now be shown in the list of group members
  
  ![](images/group-add-member-completed.png)
  
## Task 3: Creating the dynamic groups

In OCI there are multiple types of groups, we\'ve seen a group based on users, but it\'s also possible to create a **dynamic group** which represents resources within OCI itself,usually based on resources in a compartment, and can be further limited to a specific resource type. It\'s called a **dynamic group** because it matches on any resource, regardless of if the resource was created after the group was created. This means that we can define the group now, and then create the resources it matches against later on.

We are going to create three dynamic groups for identifying the code repositories, the build service and the deploy service
  
  1. Open the OCI Web based interface, Navigate to the dynamic groupspage - Click on the ""Hamburger"" menu, then **Identity & Security** then **Groups**
  
  ![](images/dynamic-groups-access-service.png)
  
  In this tenancy there are already a lot of dynamic groups, if you are in a free trial tenancy tere will probabaly not be any in the list.

  2. Click the **Create Dynamic Group** button to start the process
  
  ![](images/dynamic-groups-create-group-start.png)
  
  3. In the **Name** field name it `<YOUR INITIALS>BuildDynamicGroup`, In the **Description** enter `This dynamic group identifies the DevOps Build Pipelines`, in the rules section enter this into the **Rule 1** field, replace `<Your Copartment OCID` with the OCID your got earlier for your compartment. `ALL {resource.type = \'devopsbuildpipeline\', resource.compartment.id = \'<Your Compartment OCID>\'}` Click the **Create** button.
  
  Of course in the image below I\'m using **my** compartment ID, yours will be different !
  
  ![](images/dynamic-groups-create-group-form.png)
  
  4. The Dynamic group will be created and you\'ll be taken to it\'s page. Return to the Dynamic groups list by clicking **Dynamic groups** in the ""Breadcrumb"" path at the upper right.
  
  ![](images/dynamic-groups-group-page.png)
  
  5. Follow the above process, to create two more groups as described below, remember to replace `<YOUR INITIALS` and `<Your Compartment OCID>` in these groups.
  
  Code dynamic group:

  - Name it `<YOUR INITIALS>CodeReposDynamicGroup`

  - Description is `This dynamic group identifies the OCI code repositories resources`

  - Set the rule to `ALL {resource.type = \'devopsrepository\', resource.compartment.id = \'<Your Compartment OCID>\'}`

  Deployment dynamic group:
  
  - Name It `<YOUR INITIALS>DeployDynamicGroup`

  - Description is `This dynamic group identifies the deployment tools resources`

  - Set the rule to `ALL {resource.type = \'devopsdeploypipeline\', resource.compartment.id = \'<Your Compartment OCID>\'}`
  
  Once you have created the three dynamic groups you will see them in dynamic groups list. It is **critical** that you followed the instructions above and in particular remembered to use the OCID of **your** compartment.
  
  ![](images/dynamic-groups-all-created.pnf)
  
## Task 4: Define the policies

OCI Security uses policies to determine what groups can do. We need to setup policies that will allow our groups to perform operations within OCI. **IMPORTANT** We will be doing this based on your compartment, not on the entire tenancy (which would be a bad thing to do). 

Policies are applied in the parent of the compartment you are operating in, (or actually anything in the hierarchy, but it\'s easiest to just use the parent). In a free trial tenancy where you created the `CTDOKE` compartment in the tenancy root that means you will be applying the policies in the tenancy root (and these instructions will use that in the examples). However if for some reason you created your compartment as a sub compartment of another compartment you will need to remember to apply the policies in the parent compartment that contains the compartment you created. Of course if you chose a different compartment name you will need to use that instead of `CTDOKE`

  1. Open the OCI Web console, Now create the policies. Click the ""Hamburger"" menu, then Go to Identity & Security then Policies
  
  ![](images/policies-access-service.png)
  
  2. On the left side of the page locate the **Compartment** selector, In the image be low there are lots of compartments, the list (size and also names) will be different in your case. Click in it and *make certain* that you have selected the *parent* compartment of the compartment you created. If you created the `CTDOKE` compartment in the root (this is what you probably will have done if you are using a free trial and following the instructions) then select the *root*. If for example you had created the `TimGraves` compartment in the `Users-compartment` (this of course is my setup, yours may vary) then you will need to select `Users-Compartment` as that\'s the parent of the `TimGraves` compartment.
  
  ![](images/policies-select-compartment.png)
  
  3. Click on the `parent` of your compartment, the dropdown will collapse to show it\'s selected as per the image below. Now click on **Create Policy** to open the Create policy form. (This tenancy has lots of policies already existing in the root compartment, yours probably will not)
  
  ![](images/policies-initial-create.png)
  
  4. Name the policy `<Your initials>DevOpsUsersPolicy` Of course you should replace `<Your initials>` with your initials, so as my initials are `tg` in the example image below I\'ve named the group `tgDevopsUsersPolicy` Set the description to be `This policy allows members of the DevOps user group to interact with the DevOps services`. 
  
  ![](images/policies-create-policy-part1.png)
  
  5. Click the **Manual editor** button if it\'s not already enabled (it will be grey if not enabled and blue if enabled). In the Policy builder box paste the following AFTER substituting your initials (tg in this image) and your compartment name CTDOKE in this image `Allow group <YOUR INITIALS>DevOpsUsersGroup to manage devops-family in compartment <compartment name>` Then click the **Create** button
  
  ![](images/policy-create-policy-part2.png)
  
  6. The details of your new policy will show up in the UI click **Policies**  in the ""Breadcrumb"" trail to return to the policies list
  
  ![](images/policy-created-policy.png)
  
  7. Follow the process above to create policies that will allow the build, deploy and code repos dynamic group members (these are built using dynamic groups which will contain resources rather than users) to manage everything in the tenancy (it would be possible to put specific policy approvals in place on specific resources, but for a lab this is easier). Remember you will need to replace `<Your initials>` and `<compartment name>` and also you will need to create these in the **parent** compartment of your compartment.
  
  This allows the code repositories to trigger a build when you do a git push:
  
  - Name `<YOUR INITIALS>DevOpsCodeRepoPolicy`
  
  - Description `This policy allows the dynamic group of code repo resources resources to create trigger the build process`
  
  - Policy text `Allow dynamic-group <YOUR INITIALS>CodeReposDynamicGroup to manage all-resources in compartment <compartment name>`
  
  This allows the Build pipelines to create the build runners when you run a build 
  
  - Name `<YOUR INITIALS>DevOpsBuildPolicy`
  
  - Description `This policy allows the dynamic group of build resources resources to create build runners, and trigger deployments`

  - Policy text `Allow dynamic-group <YOUR INITIALS>BuildDynamicGroup to manage all-resources in compartment <compartment name>`
  
  This allows the deploy pipelines to manipulate the environments they are deloying to
  
  - Name `<YOUR INITIALS>DevOpsDeployPolicy`

  - Description `This policy allows the deployment tooling to interact with the destination systems (OKE, Functions etc.)`
  
  - Policy Text `Allow dynamic-group <YOUR INITIALS>DeployDynamicGroup to manage all-resources in compartment <compartment name>`
  
  Once you have created all the policies if you return to the policies list one more time (Use the ""breadcrumb"" on the upper left) you will see something like the following
  
  ![](images/policy-all-created.png)
  
  Of course these all use my initials !
  

## End of the Module, what\'s next ?

title: Content Security Policy Overview
---

A Content Security Policy (CSP) can provide additional layers of defense for Magento installations by helping to detect and mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and related data injection attacks. This common attack vector works by injecting malicious content that falsely claims to originate from the website. After the malicious content is loaded and executed, it can initiate the unauthorized transfer of data.

CSP provides a standardized set of directives that tells the browser which content resources can be trusted, and which should be blocked. Using carefully defined policies, CSP can restrict browser content to allow only whitelisted resources to appear.

## Configuration

To avoid interfering with site operations, CSP can be implemented in phases. CSP has two basic modes of operation: `report-only mode` and `restrict mode`. The release of Magento Commerce 2.3.5 marks the first phase of our implementation and makes CSP available in `report-only mode` by default. In a future release, `restrict mode` will be enabled by default for additional out-of-the-box protection.

**Report-only mode**: The browser is instructed to report policy violations, but not enforce them. Every time a requested resource violates CSP, the browser logs the resulting errors to the console. The console log can then be used to investigate the cause of each violation.

It is important to review all CSP errors as they occur and refine the policies until all necessary resources are whitelisted. It is safe to switch to `restrict mode` when no more errors occur. Otherwise, a poorly configured CSP might cause the browser to display a blank page with numerous console errors. A properly configured CSP allows whitelisted content to be delivered without any perceived impact on performance.

**Restrict mode**: The browser is instructed to enforce all content policies and limit publication to whitelisted resources. Because CSP is configured from the server, rather than from the Magento Admin, most merchants need the assistance of a system integrator or developer to configure it properly. See [Content Security Policies][] in the Magento _PHP Developer Guide_.

## Reporting

By default, CSP sends errors to the browser console, but can be configured to collect error logs by HTTP request. In addition, there are a number of third-party services that you can use to monitor, collect, and report CSP violations.

[Report URI][] is a service that monitors CSP violations and displays the results in a dashboard. Both merchants and developers can use the service to receive reports whenever CSP violations occur.

title: Content Security Policies

Content Security Policies (CSP) are a powerful tool to mitigate against Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
and related attacks, including card skimmers, session hijacking, clickjacking, and more. Web servers
send CSPs in response HTTP headers (namely `Content-Security-Policy` and
`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) to browsers that whitelist the origins of scripts, styles,
and other resources. Together, CSPs and built-in browser features help prevent:

*  Loading a malicious script from an attacker\'s website
*  A malicious inline script from sending credit card info to an attacker\'s website
*  Loading a malicious style that will make users click on an element that wasn\'t supposed to be on a page

See [Content Security Policy (CSP)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP)
and [Content-Security-Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
to learn more about CSP and each individual policy.

## Magento and CSP

As of version 2.3.5, Magento supports CSP headers and provides ways to configure them. (This
functionality is defined in the Magento_Csp module.) Magento also provides default configurations at
the application level and for individual core modules that require extra configuration. Policies can
be configured for `adminhtml` and `storefront` areas separately to accommodate different use cases.
Magento also permits configuring unique CSPs for specific pages.

CSP can work in two modes:

*  `report-only` - In this mode, Magento reports policy violations but does not interfere. This mode isuseful for debugging.  By default, CSP violations are written to the browser console, but they can be configured to be reported to an endpoint as an HTTP request to collect logs. There are a number of services that will collect, store, and sort your store\'s CSP violations reports for you.

*  `restrict mode` - In this mode, Magento acts on any policy violations.

## Default configuration

By default, CSP is configured in `report-only` mode, which allows merchants and developers to
configure policies to work according to their custom code. After the policies have been configured,
switch the mode to `restrict`.

Once configured, Magento can enforce policies like these:

*  Any resource, such as `.js`, `.css`, `.jpg`, or `.ttf` files, can only be loaded from the store\'s domain
*  Iframes can only include pages from the store itself
*  AJAX requests can only be sent to the store
*  Forms can only be sent to the store

For more details check the `Magento/Csp/etc/config.xml` file. Some domains have already been
whitelistedfor modules that require it. For instance if the `Magento_Paypal` module is installed,
`www.paypal.com` is already whitelisted for the `script-src` policy.

The following features are allowed:

*  Inline JavaScript (JavaScript inside `<script>` tags and `on<event>` HTML tags)
*  JavaScript `eval()` usage
*  Inline styles (CSS inside `<style>` tags and `style` HTML attributes)

{:.bs-callout-info}
Some of these features will be disabled by default for Magento 2.4.

## Configure a module\'s CSP mode

You can set the CSP mode in a custom module by editing the module\'s `etc/config.xml` file. To
set the mode to `restrict`, change the value of the `default/csp/mode/admin/report_only`
and/or the `default/csp/mode/storefront/report_only` element to 0. To enable `report-only` mode,
set the values to 1.

Example `config.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<config xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Store:etc/config.xsd"">
    <default>
        <csp>
            <mode>
                <storefront>
                    <report_only>0</report_only>
                </storefront>
                <admin>
                    <report_only>0</report_only>
                </admin>
            </mode>
        </csp>
    </default>
</config>
```

You can use the `etc/config.xml` file in the `Magento_Csp` module as a reference.
[Create your component file structure]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/build/module-file-structure.html)
describes how to create a module.

## Configure CSPs for your custom code/extension/theme

Magento provides multiple ways to add whitelisted resources to your custom code, extension, or theme.
Be sure to add resources only in modules that require it. For example, adding a domain to a `default-src`
policy when you only need to load a `.js` file from it is not recommended. Add the domain to `script-src`
instead.

The following table describes each type of CSP:

Policy name | Description
--- | ---
`default-src` | The default policy.
`base-uri` | Defines which URLs can appear in a page\'s `<base>` element.
`child-src` | Defines the sources for workers and embedded frame contents.
`connect-src` | Defines the sources that can be loaded using script interfaces.
`font-src` | Defines which sources can serve fonts.
`form-action` | Defines valid endpoints for submission from `<form>` tags.
`frame-ancestors` | Defines the sources that can embed the current page.
`frame-src` | Defines the sources for elements such as `<frame>` and `<iframe>`.
`img-src` | Defines the sources from which images can be loaded.
`manifest-src` | Defines the allowable contents of web app manifests.
`media-src` | Defines the sources from which images can be loaded.
`object-src` | Defines the sources for the `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements.
`script-src` | Defines the sources for JavaScript `<script>` elements.
`style-src` | Defines the sources for stylesheets.

### Add a domain to the whitelist

You can add a domain to the whitelist for a policy (like `script-src`, `style-src`, `font-src` and others) by
adding a `csp_whitelist.xml` to your custom module\'s `etc` folder.

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<csp_whitelist xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Csp:etc/csp_whitelist.xsd"">
    <policies>
        <policy id=""script-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""devdocs-base"" type=""host"">https://devdocs.magento.com</value>
                <value id=""magento"" type=""host"">https://magento.com</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
        <policy id=""connect-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""devdocs"" type=""host"">https://devdocs.magento.com</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
    </policies>
</csp_whitelist>
```

In case you include a script/css file from a `.phtml` template you can also use the dynamic whitelisting utility available
as `$csp`, which is an instance of `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`:

```html
<div>This is my page!!!</div>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'script\', [\'src\' => \'http://my.magento.com/static/script.js\']); ?>
```

### Whitelist an inline script or style

Although Magento 2.3 allows inline scripts and styles by default, this policy will change in Magento 2.4.
We recommend that you prepare your custom code/extension for the future by defining whitelists and avoiding
use of inline styles and scripts.

To whitelist a `script` or `style` HTML tag, use `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`
by adding it as a dependency to your class that renders HTML. You can also use `$csp` variables inside a `.phtml`
template.

**Inside a `.phtml` template:**

```html
<div>This is an HTML page</div>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'script\', [\'type\' => \'text/javascript\'], ""\
    let myVar = 1;\
    console.log(\'myVar = \' + myVar);\
"") ?>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'style\', [], ""\
    .#my-element {\
        width: 100%;\
    }\
"") ?>
```

**Inside a class that renders HTML:**

```php
class HtmlRenderer
{
    /**
     * @var \\Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface
     */
    private $cspUtil;

    //...

    public function renderSomeHtml(): string
    {
        $html = \'<div>This is an HTML page</div>\';
        $html .= $this->cspUtil->renderTag(
            \'script\',
            [\'type\' => \'text/javascript\'],
            ""\
    let myVar = 1;\
    console.log(\'myVar = \' + myVar);\
""
        );

        return $html;
    }
}
```

CSP does not currently allow whitelisting of JavaScript inside `on<Event>` HTML attributes or as
styles inside a `style` attribute. Replace these constructions with separate `style` and `script`
HTML tags whitelisted via `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`.

You can also whitelist inline CSS and JS inside `style` and `script` tags in a `csp_whitelist.xml` file.
To do this, get a `sha256` hash of a tag\'s content and encode it as BASE64, then
add it to your module\'s `csp_whitelist.xml`. Programmatically, it could look like this:

```php
$whitelistHash = base64_encode(hash(\'sha256\', $content, true));
```

Add the corresponding policy to a `csp_whitelist.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<csp_whitelist xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Csp:etc/csp_whitelist.xsd"">
    <policies>
        <policy id=""script-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""my-scripts-hash"" type=""hash"" algorithm=""sha256"">B4yPHKaXnvFWtRChIbabYmUBFZdVfKKXHbWtWidDVF8=</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
    </policies>
</csp_whitelist>
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
When _unsafe-inline_ is allowed for `script-src` or `style-src` policies, whitelisted inline scripts/styles hashes
will not appear in the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

### Advanced CSP configuration

To configure other CSPs such as `sandbox` policy, which does not consist of whitelisted hosts
and hashes, or for more advanced `fetch` policy configurations, like removing inline support from `script-src`,
you would have to create a `config.xml` file inside your custom module and rewrite the default values.
For reference, see `Magento\\Csp\\etc\\config.xml`.

### Report-Uri configuration

Regardless of `restrict` or `report-only` mode, CSP violations may be reported to an endpoint for collection.
The URL to use for reporting by browsers can be configured in your custom module\'s `config.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<config xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Store:etc/config.xsd"">
    <default>
        <csp>
            <mode>
                <storefront>
                    <report_uri>http://csp-reporting-service.com/my-project/endpoint</report_uri>
                </storefront>
                <admin>
                    <report_uri>http://csp-reporting-service.com/my-project/endpoint</report_uri>
                </admin>
            </mode>
        </csp>
    </default>
</config>
```

### Page specific Content-Security-Policies

Magento can send unique policies for a specific page. To do so, implement `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\CspAwareActionInterface`
in a controller responsible for the page and define the `modifyCsp` method. It receives existing CSPs
read from configs and allows you redefine them by returning a new list. See the example below:

```php
class Mypage extends \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\Action\\Action implements \\Magento\\Csp\\Api\\CspAwareActionInterface
{
    /**
     * My custom page.
     *
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function execute()
    {
        return $this->resultPageFactory->create();
    }

    public function modifyCsp(array $appliedPolicies): array
    {
        $appliedPolicies[] = new \\Magento\\Csp\\Model\\Policy\\FetchPolicy(
            \'form-action\',
            false,
            [\'https://my-site.com\'],
            [\'https\']
        );

        return $appliedPolicies;
    }
}
```

You do not need to define other policy options in contexts like _unsafe-inline_. The same
policy options read from config will be merged later.

There are a number of services that will collect, store, and sort your store\'s CSP violations reports for you.

*  `restrict mode` - In this mode, Magento acts on any policy violations.

## Default configuration

By default, CSP is configured in `report-only` mode, which allows merchants and developers to
configure policies to work according to their custom code. After the policies have been configured,
switch the mode to `restrict`.

Once configured, Magento can enforce policies like these:

*  Any resource, such as `.js`, `.css`, `.jpg`, or `.ttf` files, can only be loaded from the store\'s domain
*  Iframes can only include pages from the store itself
*  AJAX requests can only be sent to the store
*  Forms can only be sent to the store

For more details check the `Magento/Csp/etc/config.xml` file. Some domains have already been
whitelistedfor modules that require it. For instance if the `Magento_Paypal` module is installed,
`www.paypal.com` is already whitelisted for the `script-src` policy.

The following features are allowed:

*  Inline JavaScript (JavaScript inside `<script>` tags and `on<event>` HTML tags)
*  JavaScript `eval()` usage
*  Inline styles (CSS inside `<style>` tags and `style` HTML attributes)

{:.bs-callout-info}
Some of these features will be disabled by default for Magento 2.4.

## Configure a module\'s CSP mode

You can set the CSP mode in a custom module by editing the module\'s `etc/config.xml` file. To
set the mode to `restrict`, change the value of the `default/csp/mode/admin/report_only`
and/or the `default/csp/mode/storefront/report_only` element to 0. To enable `report-only` mode,
set the values to 1.

Example `config.xml`:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<config xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Store:etc/config.xsd"">
    <default>
        <csp>
            <mode>
                <storefront>
                    <report_only>0</report_only>
                </storefront>
                <admin>
                    <report_only>0</report_only>
                </admin>
            </mode>
        </csp>
    </default>
</config>
```

You can use the `etc/config.xml` file in the `Magento_Csp` module as a reference.
[Create your component file structure]({{page.baseurl}}/extension-dev-guide/build/module-file-structure.html)
describes how to create a module.

## Configure CSPs for your custom code/extension/theme

Magento provides multiple ways to add whitelisted resources to your custom code, extension, or theme.
Be sure to add resources only in modules that require it. For example, adding a domain to a `default-src`
policy when you only need to load a `.js` file from it is not recommended. Add the domain to `script-src`
instead.

The following table describes each type of CSP:

Policy name | Description
--- | ---
`default-src` | The default policy.
`base-uri` | Defines which URLs can appear in a page\'s `<base>` element.
`child-src` | Defines the sources for workers and embedded frame contents.
`connect-src` | Defines the sources that can be loaded using script interfaces.
`font-src` | Defines which sources can serve fonts.
`form-action` | Defines valid endpoints for submission from `<form>` tags.
`frame-ancestors` | Defines the sources that can embed the current page.
`frame-src` | Defines the sources for elements such as `<frame>` and `<iframe>`.
`img-src` | Defines the sources from which images can be loaded.
`manifest-src` | Defines the allowable contents of web app manifests.
`media-src` | Defines the sources from which images can be loaded.
`object-src` | Defines the sources for the `<object>`, `<embed>`, and `<applet>` elements.
`script-src` | Defines the sources for JavaScript `<script>` elements.
`style-src` | Defines the sources for stylesheets.

### Add a domain to the whitelist

You can add a domain to the whitelist for a policy (like `script-src`, `style-src`, `font-src` and others) by
adding a `csp_whitelist.xml` to your custom module\'s `etc` folder.

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<csp_whitelist xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Csp:etc/csp_whitelist.xsd"">
    <policies>
        <policy id=""script-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""devdocs-base"" type=""host"">{{ site.baseurl }}</value>
                <value id=""magento"" type=""host"">https://magento.com</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
        <policy id=""connect-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""devdocs"" type=""host"">{{ site.baseurl }}</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
    </policies>
</csp_whitelist>
```

In case you include a script/css file from a `.phtml` template you can also use the dynamic whitelisting utility available
as `$csp`, which is an instance of `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`:

```html
<div>This is my page!!!</div>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'script\', [\'src\' => \'http://my.magento.com/static/script.js\']); ?>
```

### Whitelist an inline script or style

Although Magento 2.3 allows inline scripts and styles by default, this policy will change in Magento 2.4.
We recommend that you prepare your custom code/extension for the future by defining whitelists and avoiding
use of inline styles and scripts.

To whitelist a `script` or `style` HTML tag, use `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`
by adding it as a dependency to your class that renders HTML. You can also use `$csp` variables inside a `.phtml`
template.

**Inside a `.phtml` template:**

```html
<div>This is an HTML page</div>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'script\', [\'type\' => \'text/javascript\'], ""\
    let myVar = 1;\
    console.log(\'myVar = \' + myVar);\
"") ?>
<?= /* @noEscape */ $csp->renderTag(\'style\', [], ""\
    .#my-element {\
        width: 100%;\
    }\
"") ?>
```

**Inside a class that renders HTML:**

```php
class HtmlRenderer
{
    /**
     * @var \\Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface
     */
    private $cspUtil;

    //...

    public function renderSomeHtml(): string
    {
        $html = \'<div>This is an HTML page</div>\';
        $html .= $this->cspUtil->renderTag(
            \'script\',
            [\'type\' => \'text/javascript\'],
            ""\
    let myVar = 1;\
    console.log(\'myVar = \' + myVar);\
""
        );

        return $html;
    }
}
```

CSP does not currently allow whitelisting of JavaScript inside `on<Event>` HTML attributes or as
styles inside a `style` attribute. Replace these constructions with separate `style` and `script`
HTML tags whitelisted via `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\InlineUtilInterface`.

You can also whitelist inline CSS and JS inside `style` and `script` tags in a `csp_whitelist.xml` file.
To do this, get a `sha256` hash of a tag\'s content and encode it as BASE64, then
add it to your module\'s `csp_whitelist.xml`. Programmatically, it could look like this:

```php
$whitelistHash = base64_encode(hash(\'sha256\', $content, true));
```

Add the corresponding policy to a `csp_whitelist.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<csp_whitelist xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Csp:etc/csp_whitelist.xsd"">
    <policies>
        <policy id=""script-src"">
            <values>
                <value id=""my-scripts-hash"" type=""hash"" algorithm=""sha256"">B4yPHKaXnvFWtRChIbabYmUBFZdVfKKXHbWtWidDVF8=</value>
            </values>
        </policy>
    </policies>
</csp_whitelist>
```

{:.bs-callout-info}
When _unsafe-inline_ is allowed for `script-src` or `style-src` policies, whitelisted inline scripts/styles hashes
will not appear in the `Content-Security-Policy` header.

### Advanced CSP configuration

To configure other CSPs such as `sandbox` policy, which does not consist of whitelisted hosts
and hashes, or for more advanced `fetch` policy configurations, like removing inline support from `script-src`,
you would have to create a `config.xml` file inside your custom module and rewrite the default values.
For reference, see `Magento\\Csp\\etc\\config.xml`.

### Report-Uri configuration

Regardless of `restrict` or `report-only` mode, CSP violations may be reported to an endpoint for collection.
The URL to use for reporting by browsers can be configured in your custom module\'s `config.xml` file:

```xml
<?xml version=""1.0""?>
<config xmlns:xsi=""http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation=""urn:magento:module:Magento_Store:etc/config.xsd"">
    <default>
        <csp>
            <mode>
                <storefront>
                    <report_uri>http://csp-reporting-service.com/my-project/endpoint</report_uri>
                </storefront>
                <admin>
                    <report_uri>http://csp-reporting-service.com/my-project/endpoint</report_uri>
                </admin>
            </mode>
        </csp>
    </default>
</config>
```

### Page specific Content-Security-Policies

Magento can send unique policies for a specific page. To do so, implement `Magento\\Csp\\Api\\CspAwareActionInterface`
in a controller responsible for the page and define the `modifyCsp` method. It receives existing CSPs
read from configs and allows you redefine them by returning a new list. See the example below:

```php
class Mypage extends \\Magento\\Framework\\App\\Action\\Action implements \\Magento\\Csp\\Api\\CspAwareActionInterface
{
    /**
     * My custom page.
     *
     * @inheritDoc
     */
    public function execute()
    {
        return $this->resultPageFactory->create();
    }

    public function modifyCsp(array $appliedPolicies): array
    {
        $appliedPolicies[] = new \\Magento\\Csp\\Model\\Policy\\FetchPolicy(
            \'form-action\',
            false,
            [\'https://my-site.com\'],
            [\'https\']
        );

        return $appliedPolicies;
    }
}
```

You do not need to define other policy options in contexts like _unsafe-inline_. The same
policy options read from config will be merged later.

title: Can\'t use a virtual directory to host applications

# System.Security.SecurityException when the virtual directory points to a remote share in ASP.NET

This article helps you resolve the problem that `System.Security.SecurityException` may be thrown when you use a virtual directory that points to a remote share to host a Microsoft ASP.NET-based application.

_Original product version:_ &nbsp; ASP.NET  
_Original KB number:_ &nbsp; 320268

## Symptoms

When you use a virtual directory that points to a remote share to host an ASP.NET-based application, you may receive an error message that is similar to one of the following examples:

- Message 1

    > Security Exception Description: The application attempted to perform an operation not allowed by the security policy. To grant this application the required permission please contact your system administrator or change the application\'s trust level in the configuration file.  
    > Exception Details: System.Security.SecurityException: Security error.  
    > Source Error:  
    > Line 30: private static bool __intialized = false; Line 31: Line 32: public Global_asax() { Line 33: if ((ASP.Global_asax.__intialized == false)) { Line 34: ASP.Global_asax.__intialized = true;

- Message 2

    > Server Error in /ApplicationName Application.  
    > Parser Error Description: An error occurred during the parsing of a resource required to service this request. Please review the following specific parse error details and modify your source file appropriately.  
    > Parser Error Message: Could not load type ApplicationName.Global.  
    > Source Error: Line 1: <%@ Application Codebehind=""Global.asax.cs"" Inherits=""ApplicationName.Global"" %> Source File: Path of Application\\global.asax Line: 1

## Cause

The `System.Web` namespace doesn\'t have the `AllowPartiallyTrustedCallersAttribute` applied to it. For more information, visit [patterns & practices](/previous-versions/msp-n-p/ff921345(v=pandp.10)).

Any code that isn\'t in the **My_Computer_Zone** code group that doesn\'t have this attribute requires the **FullTrust** user right. So the remote share that holds the Web applications content requires **FullTrust**.

## Resolution

To resolve this behavior, grant the **FullTrust** right to the remote share:

1. On the Web server, open Administrative Tools, and then double-click **Microsoft .NET Framework Configuration**.
2. Expand **Runtime Security Policy**, expand **Machine**, and then expand **Code Groups**.
3. Right-click **All_Code**, and then select **New**.
4. Select **Create a new code group**. Give your code group a relevant name, such as the name of the applications share. Select **Next**.
5. In the **Choose the condition type for this code group** list, select **URL**.
6. In the **URL** box, type the path of the share in the following format:  
    `file:////\\\\computername\\\\sharename\\*`

    > [!NOTE]
    > Replace *computername* with the name of the computer that is hosting the remote share. Replace *sharename* with the name of the share.

7. Select **Next**. On the next page, select **Use an existing permission set**, and then select **FullTrust**.
8. Select **Next**, and then select **Finish**.
9. Restart Internet Information Services (IIS) to restart the ASP.NET worker process.

If **Microsoft .NET Framework Configuration** isn\'t displayed under **Administrative Tools**, you can install the .NET Framework Software Development Kit (SDK) to add **Microsoft .NET Framework Configuration**. Instead, you can run the following command to make the change:

```console
Drive :\\WINDOWS\\Microsoft.NET\\Framework\\v2.0.50727\\caspol.exe -m -ag 1 -url ""file:////\\\\computername\\sharename\\*"" FullTrust -exclusive on
```

For more information about what these arguments do, run the following command:  

```console
caspol.exe -?
```

## Status

This behavior is by design.

## More information

In this configuration, the account under which the ASP.NET worker process runs must have sufficient rights to the remote share. You can set the account under which the worker process runs by using the `<processmodel>` tag in the *Machine.config* file.

### Steps to reproduce the behavior

1. Create a new virtual directory that points to a remote share.
2. Create an application for the virtual directory. Make sure that the user who connects to the share has read access to the remote content.
3. In the `<processmodel>` tag of the *Machine.config* file, change the user to a domain user who has list, read, and execute permissions on the remote share.
4. Create an inline .aspx file, and then put the file in the remote share.
5. Make a request for the page.

'","b'Security Configuration
======================

This document will help you configure the Opencast security policy.

## Introduction

Opencast service endpoints and user interfaces are secured by default using a set of servlet filters. The following
diagram illustrates the flow of an HTTP request and response through these filters.

![Diagram](security1.png)

The Spring Security filters used here are very powerful, but are also somewhat complicated. Please familiarize yourself
with the basic concepts and vocabulary described in the Spring Security documentation, then edit the xml files in
`etc/security`, as described below.

## Configure Access

To configure access roles and URL patterns for a tenant, modify `/etc/security/{{tenant_identifier.xml}}`.  If you are
not hosting multiple tenants on your Opencast server or cluster, all configuration should be done in
`mh_default_org.xml`.

Some examples:

    <!-- Allow anonymous access to the welcome.html URLs -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/welcome.html\' access=\'ROLE_ANONYMOUS,ROLE_USER\'/>

    <!-- Allow anonymous GET to the search service, but not POST or PUT -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/search/**\' method=""GET"" access=\'ROLE_ANONYMOUS,ROLE_USER\' />

    <!-- Allow users with the admin role to do anything -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/**\' access=\'ROLE_ADMIN\'/>

## Authentication Provider

Opencast specifies an AuthenticationProvider by default, using a UserDetailService that is obtained from the OSGI
service registry.

You can use this simple provider as is, loading users into the `oc_user` and `oc_role` database tables, and specifying
an administrative username and password in `custom.properties`:

    org.opencastproject.security.digest.user=opencast_system_account
    org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass=CHANGE_ME

## User and Role Providers

Opencast allows user and role information to be supplied from external systems through user and role providers.
Four user providers are available by default:

* LDAP User Provider, described in [LDAP Security and Authorization](security.ldap.md)
* [Sakai User Provider](security.user.sakai.md)
* [Moodle User Provider](security.user.moodle.md)
* [Brightspace D2L User Provider](security.user.brightspace.md)

The set of user and role providers can be configured. If you do not want to keep users and passwords in Opencast\'s
database, you can replace the JpaUserAndRoleProvider with the LdapUserProvider by replacing the
userdirectory-jpa jar with the userdirectory-ldap jar.

## Further Authentication Configuration

* [Configure Central Authentication Service (CAS)](security.cas.md)
* [Configure LDAP Authentication and Authorization](security.ldap.md)
* [Configure Authentication and Authorization Infrastructure (AAI)](security.aai.md)

Vulnerabilities can be reported by emailing core members:

- Romain Brault [mail@romainbrault.com](mailto:mail@romainbrault.com)

Or using [GitHub draft security advisory](https://github.com/RomainBrault/python-whiteprint/security/advisories/new).

Be sure to include as much detail as necessary in your report. As with
reporting normal issues, a minimal reproducible example will help the
maintainers address the issue faster. If you are able, you may also include a

'","b'Security Configuration
======================

This document will help you configure the Opencast security policy.

## Introduction

Opencast service endpoints and user interfaces are secured by default using a set of servlet filters. The following
diagram illustrates the flow of an HTTP request and response through these filters.

![Diagram](security1.png)

The Spring Security filters used here are very powerful, but are also somewhat complicated. Please familiarize yourself
with the basic concepts and vocabulary described in the Spring Security documentation, then edit the xml files in
`etc/security`, as described below.

## Configure Access

To configure access roles and URL patterns for a tenant, modify `/etc/security/{{tenant_identifier.xml}}`.  If you are
not hosting multiple tenants on your Opencast server or cluster, all configuration should be done in
`mh_default_org.xml`.

Some examples:

    <!-- Allow anonymous access to the welcome.html URLs -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/welcome.html\' access=\'ROLE_ANONYMOUS,ROLE_USER\'/>

    <!-- Allow anonymous GET to the search service, but not POST or PUT -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/search/**\' method=""GET"" access=\'ROLE_ANONYMOUS,ROLE_USER\' />

    <!-- Allow users with the admin role to do anything -->
    <sec:intercept-url pattern=\'/**\' access=\'ROLE_ADMIN\'/>

## Authentication Provider

Opencast specifies an AuthenticationProvider by default, using a UserDetailService that is obtained from the OSGI
service registry.

You can use this simple provider as is, loading users into the `mh_user` and `mh_role` database tables, and specifying
an administrative username and password in `custom.properties`:

    org.opencastproject.security.digest.user=opencast_system_account
    org.opencastproject.security.digest.pass=CHANGE_ME

The set of user and role providers can be configured. If you do not want to keep users and passwords in Opencast\'s
database, you can replace the JpaUserAndRoleProvider with the LdapUserProvider by replacing the
matterhorn-userdirectory-jpa jar with the matterhorn-userdirectory-ldap jar.

## Supported Versions

The Jaeger project provides community support only for last minor version: bug fixes are released either as part of the next minor version or as an on-demand patch version. Independent of which version is next, all patch versions are cumulative, meaning that they represent the state of our `main` branch at the moment of the release. For instance, if the latest version is 1.19.0, bug fixes are released either as part of 1.20.0 or 1.19.1.

Security fixes are given priority and might be enough to cause a new version to be released.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

_The following is a copy of the [Report a security issue](https://www.jaegertracing.io/report-security-issue/) page from our website. The website\'s version has precedence in case of conflicts._

If you find something suspicious and want to report it, we\'d really appreciate!

## Ways to report

The easiest way to report a vulnerability is through the [Security tab on GitHub](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/security/advisories). This mechanism allows maintainers to communicate privately with you, and you do not need to encrypt your messages.

Alternatively, you can use one of the following public channels to send an **encrypted** message to maintainers:

* Chat room on the [#jaeger channel at the CNCF Slack][slack-room]
* Send a message to [jaeger-tracing@googlegroups.com][mailing-list]
* [Open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/issues)

You can also submit a fix to the issue by forking the affected repository and sending us a pull request. However, we prefer you\'d talk to us first, as our repositories are public and we would like to give a heads-up to our users before disclosing vulnerabilities publicly.

## Our PGP key

If you choose a public channel to communicate with us, please **encrypt your message** using [our public key](#our-public-key) `ID=C043A4D2B3F2AC31`. It is available in all major key servers and should match the one shown below.

If you are new to PGP, you can run the following command to encrypt a file called ""message.txt"":

```shell
# Receive our keys from a key server:
gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C043A4D2B3F2AC31

# Alternatively, copy the key below to file C043A4D2B3F2AC31.asc and import it:
gpg --import C043A4D2B3F2AC31.asc

# Encrypt a ""message.txt"" file into ""message.txt.asc"":
gpg -ea -r C043A4D2B3F2AC31 message.txt

# Send us the resulting ""message.txt.asc""
```

[Mozilla\xe2\x80\x99s HTTP Observatory CLI](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory-cli) and the
[Qualys SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) are good resources for finding
potential problems and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

<!-- Uncomment these sections when CSP/SRI are implemented.
### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy is a web standard that intends to mitigate certain
forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as well as data injection.

Content Security Policy rules should be taken into consideration when
implementing new features, especially those that may rely on connection with
external services.

GitLab's CSP is used for the following:

- Blocking plugins like Flash and Silverlight from running at all on our pages.
- Blocking the use of scripts and stylesheets downloaded from external sources.
- Upgrading `http` requests to `https` when possible.
- Preventing `iframe` elements from loading in most contexts.

Some exceptions include:

- Scripts from Google Analytics and Piwik if either is enabled.
- Connecting with GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab.com, etc. to allow project importing.
- Connecting with Google, Twitter, GitHub, etc. to allow OAuth authentication.

We use [the Secure Headers gem](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) to enable Content
Security Policy headers in the GitLab Rails app.

Some resources on implementing Content Security Policy:

- [MDN Article on CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP)
- [GitHub\xe2\x80\x99s CSP Journey on the GitHub Engineering Blog](http://githubengineering.com/githubs-csp-journey/)
- The Dropbox Engineering Blog's series on CSP: [1](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/on-csp-reporting-and-filtering/), [2](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/unsafe-inline-and-nonce-deployment/), [3](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/csp-the-unexpected-eval/), [4](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/csp-third-party-integrations-and-privilege-separation/)

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)

Subresource Integrity prevents malicious assets from being provided by a CDN by
guaranteeing that the asset downloaded is identical to the asset the server
is expecting.

The Rails app generates a unique hash of the asset, which is used as the
asset's `integrity` attribute. The browser generates the hash of the asset
on-load and will reject the asset if the hashes do not match.

All CSS and JavaScript assets should use Subresource Integrity.

Some resources on implementing Subresource Integrity:

- [MDN Article on SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/security/subresource_integrity)
- [Subresource Integrity on the GitHub Engineering Blog](http://githubengineering.com/subresource-integrity/)

-->

## Including external resources

External fonts, CSS, and JavaScript should never be used with the exception of
Google Analytics and Piwik - and only when the instance has enabled it. Assets
should always be hosted and served locally from the GitLab instance. Embedded
resources via `iframes` should never be used except in certain circumstances
such as with reCAPTCHA, which cannot be used without an `iframe`.

## Avoiding inline scripts and styles

In order to protect users from [XSS vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), we will disable
inline scripts in the future using Content Security Policy.

While inline scripts can be useful, they're also a security concern. If
user-supplied content is unintentionally left un-sanitized, malicious users can
inject scripts into the web app.

Inline styles should be avoided in almost all cases, they should only be used
when no alternatives can be found. This allows reusability of styles as well as
readability.

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)

Subresource Integrity prevents malicious assets from being provided by a CDN by
guaranteeing that the asset downloaded is identical to the asset the server
is expecting.

The Rails app generates a unique hash of the asset, which is used as the
asset's `integrity` attribute. The browser generates the hash of the asset
on-load and will reject the asset if the hashes do not match.

All CSS and JavaScript assets should use Subresource Integrity.

## Including external resources

External fonts, CSS, and JavaScript should never be used with the exception of
Google Analytics and Matomo - and only when the instance has enabled it. Assets
should always be hosted and served locally from the GitLab instance. Embedded
resources via `iframes` should never be used except in certain circumstances
such as with reCAPTCHA, which cannot be used without an `iframe`.

## Avoiding inline scripts and styles

In order to protect users from [XSS vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), we intend to disable
inline scripts in the future using Content Security Policy.

While inline scripts can make something easier, they're also a security concern. If
user-supplied content is unintentionally left un-sanitized, malicious users can
inject scripts into the web app.

Inline styles should be avoided in almost all cases, they should only be used
when no alternatives can be found. This allows reusability of styles as well as
readability.

### Sanitize HTML output

If you need to output raw HTML, you should sanitize it.

If you are using Vue, you can use the[`v-safe-html` directive](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/directives-safe-html-directive--default) from GitLab UI.

For other use cases, wrap a preconfigured version of [`dompurify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify)
that also allows the icons to be rendered:

```javascript
import { sanitize } from '~/lib/dompurify';

const unsafeHtml = '<some unsafe content ... >';

// ...

element.appendChild(sanitize(unsafeHtml));
```

This `sanitize` function takes the same configuration as the
original.

### Fixing Security Issues

When refactoring old code, it's important that we don't accidentally remove specs written to catch security issues which might still be relevant.

We should mark specs with `#security` in either the `describe` or `it` blocks to communicate to the engineer reading the code that by removing these specs could have severe consequences down the road, and you are removing code that could catch a reintroduction of a security issue.

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy is a web standard that intends to mitigate certain
forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as well as data injection.

Content Security Policy rules should be taken into consideration when
implementing new features, especially those that may rely on connection with
external services.

GitLab's CSP is used for the following:

- Blocking plugins like Flash and Silverlight from running at all on our pages.
- Blocking the use of scripts and stylesheets downloaded from external sources.
- Upgrading `http` requests to `https` when possible.
- Preventing `iframe` elements from loading in most contexts.

Some exceptions include:

- Scripts from Google Analytics and Matomo if either is enabled.
- Connecting with GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab.com, etc. to allow project importing.
- Connecting with Google, Twitter, GitHub, etc. to allow OAuth authentication.

We use [the Secure Headers gem](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) to enable Content
Security Policy headers in the GitLab Rails app.

If you are using Vue, you can use the[`v-safe-html` directive](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/directives-safe-html-directive--default) from GitLab UI.

For other use cases, wrap a preconfigured version of [`dompurify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify)
that also allows the icons to be rendered:

```javascript
import { sanitize } from '~/lib/dompurify';

const unsafeHtml = '<some unsafe content ... >';

// ...

element.appendChild(sanitize(unsafeHtml));
```

This `sanitize` function takes the same configuration as the
original.

# Security

## Resources

[Mozilla's HTTP Observatory CLI](https://github.com/mozilla/http-observatory-cli) and
[Qualys SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html) are good resources for finding
potential problems and ensuring compliance with security best practices.

<!-- Uncomment these sections when CSP/SRI are implemented.
### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy is a web standard that intends to mitigate certain
forms of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) as well as data injection.

Content Security Policy rules should be taken into consideration when
implementing new features, especially those that may rely on connection with
external services.

GitLab's CSP is used for the following:

- Blocking plugins like Flash and Silverlight from running at all on our pages.
- Blocking the use of scripts and stylesheets downloaded from external sources.
- Upgrading `http` requests to `https` when possible.
- Preventing `iframe` elements from loading in most contexts.

Some exceptions include:

- Scripts from Google Analytics and Matomo if either is enabled.
- Connecting with GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab.com, etc. to allow project importing.
- Connecting with Google, Twitter, GitHub, etc. to allow OAuth authentication.

We use [the Secure Headers gem](https://github.com/twitter/secureheaders) to enable Content
Security Policy headers in the GitLab Rails app.

Some resources on implementing Content Security Policy:

- [MDN Article on CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP)
- [GitHub's CSP Journey on the GitHub Engineering Blog](https://github.blog/2016-04-12-githubs-csp-journey/)
- The Dropbox Engineering Blog's series on CSP: [1](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/on-csp-reporting-and-filtering/), [2](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/unsafe-inline-and-nonce-deployment/), [3](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/csp-the-unexpected-eval/), [4](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2015/09/csp-third-party-integrations-and-privilege-separation/)

### Subresource Integrity (SRI)

Subresource Integrity prevents malicious assets from being provided by a CDN by
guaranteeing that the asset downloaded is identical to the asset the server
is expecting.

The Rails app generates a unique hash of the asset, which is used as the
asset's `integrity` attribute. The browser generates the hash of the asset
on-load and will reject the asset if the hashes do not match.

All CSS and JavaScript assets should use Subresource Integrity.

Some resources on implementing Subresource Integrity:

- [MDN Article on SRI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/security/subresource_integrity)
- [Subresource Integrity on the GitHub Engineering Blog](https://github.blog/2015-09-19-subresource-integrity/)

-->

## Including external resources

External fonts, CSS, and JavaScript should never be used with the exception of
Google Analytics and Matomo - and only when the instance has enabled it. Assets
should always be hosted and served locally from the GitLab instance. Embedded
resources via `iframes` should never be used except in certain circumstances
such as with reCAPTCHA, which cannot be used without an `iframe`.

## Avoiding inline scripts and styles

In order to protect users from [XSS vulnerabilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting), we intend to disable
inline scripts in the future using Content Security Policy.

While inline scripts can make something easier, they're also a security concern. If
user-supplied content is unintentionally left un-sanitized, malicious users can
inject scripts into the web app.

Inline styles should be avoided in almost all cases, they should only be used
when no alternatives can be found. This allows reusability of styles as well as
readability.

### Sanitize HTML output

If you need to output raw HTML, you should sanitize it.

If you are using Vue, you can use the[`v-safe-html` directive](https://gitlab-org.gitlab.io/gitlab-ui/?path=/story/directives-safe-html-directive--default) from GitLab UI.

For other use cases, wrap a preconfigured version of [`dompurify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dompurify)
that also allows the icons to be rendered:

```javascript
import { sanitize } from '~/lib/dompurify';

const unsafeHtml = '<some unsafe content ... >';

// ...

element.appendChild(sanitize(unsafeHtml));
```

This `sanitize` function takes the same configuration as the
original.

### Fixing Security Issues

When refactoring old code, it's important that we don't accidentally remove specs written to catch security issues which might still be relevant.

We should mark specs with `#security` in either the `describe` or `it` blocks to communicate to the engineer reading the code that by removing these specs could have severe consequences down the road, and you are removing code that could catch a reintroduction of a security issue.

## Supported Versions

Generally, only the latest version of Jetpack has continued support. If a critical vulnerability is found in the current version of Jetpack, we may opt to backport any patches to previous versions. 

## Reporting a Vulnerability

[Jetpack](https://jetpack.com/) is an open-source plugin for WordPress. Our HackerOne program covers the plugin software, as well as a variety of related projects and infrastructure.

**For responsible disclosure of security issues and to be eligible for our bug bounty program, please submit your report via the [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/automattic) portal.**

Our most critical targets are:

* Jetpack and the Jetpack composer packages (all within this repo)
* Jetpack.com -- the primary marketing site.
* cloud.jetpack.com -- a management site.
* wordpress.com -- the shared management site for both Jetpack and WordPress.com sites.

For more targets, see the `In Scope` section on [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/automattic).

_Please note that the **WordPress software is a separate entity** from Automattic. Please report vulnerabilities for WordPress through [the WordPress Foundation's HackerOne page](https://hackerone.com/wordpress)._

## Guidelines

We're committed to working with security researchers to resolve the vulnerabilities they discover. You can help us by following these guidelines:

*   Follow [HackerOne's disclosure guidelines](https://www.hackerone.com/disclosure-guidelines).
*   Pen-testing Production:
    *   Please **setup a local environment** instead whenever possible. Most of our code is open source (see above).
    *   If that's not possible, **limit any data access/modification** to the bare minimum necessary to reproduce a PoC.
    *   **_Don't_ automate form submissions!** That's very annoying for us, because it adds extra work for the volunteers who manage those systems, and reduces the signal/noise ratio in our communication channels.
    *   To be eligible for a bounty, all of these guidelines must be followed.
*   Be Patient - Give us a reasonable time to correct the issue before you disclose the vulnerability.

We also expect you to comply with all applicable laws. You're responsible to pay any taxes associated with your bounties.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security problem in Linkerd, please contact the Security Alert Team:

The team will help diagnose the severity of the issue and determine how to
address the issue. Issues deemed to be non-critical will be filed as GitHub
issues. Critical issues will receive immediate attention and be fixed as quickly
as possible.

## Security Advisories

When serious security problems in Linkerd are discovered and corrected, we issue
a security advisory, describing the problem and containing a pointer to the fix.
These are announced to our cncf-linkerd-announce mailing list as well as to
various other mailing lists and websites.

Security issues are fixed as soon as possible, and the fixes are propagated to
the stable branches as fast as possible. However, when a vulnerability is found
during a code audit, or when several other issues are likely to be spotted and
fixed in the near future, the security team may delay the release of a Security
Advisory, so that one unique, comprehensive Security Advisory covering several
vulnerabilities can be issued. Communication with vendors and other

'","b""# Security policy for GLib

 * [Supported Versions](#Supported-Versions)
 * [Reporting a Vulnerability](#Reporting-a-Vulnerability)
 * [Security Announcements](#Security-Announcements)
 * [Acknowledgements](#Acknowledgements)

## Supported Versions

Upstream GLib only supports the most recent stable release series, and the
current development release series. Any older stable release series are no
longer supported, although they may still receive backported security updates
in long-term support distributions. Such support is up to the distributions,
though.

Under GLib\xe2\x80\x99s versioning scheme, stable release series have an *even* minor
component (for example, 2.66.0, 2.66.1, 2.68.3), and development release series
have an *odd* minor component (2.67.1, 2.69.0).

## Signed Releases

The git tags for all releases \xe2\x89\xa52.58.0 are signed by a maintainer using
[git-evtag](https://github.com/cgwalters/git-evtag). The maintainer will use
their personal GPG key; there is currently not necessarily a formal chain of
trust for these keys. Please [create an issue](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/new)
if you would like to work on improving this.

Unsigned releases \xe2\x89\xa52.58.0 should not be trusted. Releases prior to 2.58.0 were
not signed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you think you've identified a security issue in GLib, GObject or GIO, please
**do not** report the issue publicly via a mailing list, IRC, a public issue on
the GitLab issue tracker, a merge request, or any other public venue.

Instead, report a
[*confidential* issue in the GitLab issue tracker](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/glib/-/issues/new?issue[confidential]=1),
with the \xe2\x80\x9cThis issue is confidential\xe2\x80\x9d box checked. Please include as many
details as possible, including a minimal reproducible example of the issue, and
an idea of how exploitable/severe you think it is.

**Do not** provide a merge request to fix the issue, as there is currently no
way to make confidential merge requests on gitlab.gnome.org. If you have patches
which fix the security issue, please attach them to your confidential issue as
patch files.

Confidential issues are only visible to the reporter and the GLib maintainers.

As per the [GNOME security policy](https://security.gnome.org/), the next steps
are then:
 * The report is triaged.
 * Code is audited to find any potential similar problems.
 * If it is determined, in consultation with the submitter, that a CVE is
   required, the submitter obtains one via [cveform.mitre.org](https://cveform.mitre.org/).
 * The fix is prepared for the development branch, and for the most recent
   stable branch.
 * The fix is submitted to the public repository.
 * On the day the issue and fix are made public, an announcement is made on the
   [public channels listed below](#Security-Announcements).
 * A new release containing the fix is issued.

## Security Announcements

Security announcements are made publicly via the
[`distributor` tag on discourse.gnome.org](https://discourse.gnome.org/tag/distributor)
and cross-posted to the
[distributor-list](https://mail.gnome.org/mailman/listinfo/distributor-list).

Announcements for security issues with wide applicability or high impact may
additionally be made via
[oss-security@lists.openwall.com](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/).
